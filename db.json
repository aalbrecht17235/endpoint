            "Body": "Traffic circles, sometimes called rotaries (if they’re large scale) or roundabouts, are a type of circular intersection. Yes, they’re round and strange and you might find them confusing at first, but remember: it’s just an intersection.\n\nIn addition to providing a nice little center island green space with shrubs to drive around, roundabouts, with their yield signs and low speeds, are actually safer than your average four-way intersection. They can also be way less confusing once you get the hang of them since every motor vehicle is turning in a clockwise direction. They're also much easier for large vehicles and emergency vehicles to navigate.\n\n**Who has the right of way?**\n-----------------------------\n\nIt’s pretty simple. If a vehicle is already in the traffic circle, they have the right of way.\n\nYou wouldn’t walk right up to a cashier and try to check out at the store if someone else was in the middle of getting their groceries scanned, right? Just wait your turn and everything will be great.\n\nIn some situations, there may be a traffic control device like a stop sign or stoplight at each entrance of the modern roundabout. If that’s the case, do what these traffic signals say. There will usually be some kind of roundabout guide like a pavement marking or sign at the entrances giving you an idea of how to proceed.\n\n![traffic circle](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lane-control-sign.png) Traffic circle lane control sign, courtesy California Department of Transportation\n\n**How do you drive in a traffic circle?**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nWhen you get to the traffic roundabout and see that it’s clear of other vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians, it’s time to join the circular party. Turn RIGHT, do not make a left turn. Traffic circles are basically one-way streets. A left turn into a roundabout would feel totally wrong, and you could end up in a head-on collision.\n\nContinue driving along the circle following traffic flow until you reach the street that you want to exit. If you’re in the interior lane of a really big circle, you will need to change lanes to exit. You'll always need to be in the right lane to exit. Simply merge onto the street of your choice. See? Not so bad."

Drinking and driving is one of the worst things a person can do. Find out how much a DUI could cost you (Spoiler: It will cost you more than just money.)\r\n\r\n Cost of Life\r\n------------\r\n\r\nIn 2013, in the state of Texas alone, there were 25,158 alcohol-related crashes resulting in 1,022 deaths. Over a thousand people had their lives cut short, many of them being innocent victims who paid the ultimate price for someone else’s mistake. Drunk driving often leads to terrible, irreversible consequences. It’s not worth the risk.\r\n\r\nCost of Freedom\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nIf you’re convicted of driving under the influence, life as you know it will get worse for a while. You could be assigned up to 100 hours of community service. You know what’s better than spending your Saturday mornings picking up garbage? Almost anything else. You could even get jail time. If you like having the freedom to wear, eat, and do what you want, avoid that jail life. Don’t drink and drive.\r\n\r\nFinancial Cost\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, DUI’s simply cost a whole lotta money. We’re talkin’ legal fees, fines, increased insurance premiums, and bail. The total bill can easily reach $10,000. That’s not even counting the money you’re missing out on via lost wages. Every day you spend in jail, doing community service, or going to court is a day you could have spent making money at work or just enjoying life."

Chugga-chugga, choo-choo.\r\n\r\n**Dinah, Blow Your Horn**\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nIf hear that train whistle, you know it’s time to S-T-O-P. When approaching a train crossing, you’ll often see advance warning signs. (But not always!) The most common warning sign is a big yellow circle with an “X” and the letters “RR.” No, the “RR” does not stand for RiRi.\r\n\r\nMe: Haha I can totally beat this train\r\n\r\nTrain:\r\n\r\nIf the train is already on its way, you might see flashing red lights. Like most other traffic signals in the world, red lights most definitely mean stop. Don’t try to gun it and zoom through the tracks. You’re not that good.\r\n\r\nIn the following situations, you must stop at least 15 feet in front of train tracks, according to the Federal Railroad Administration:\r\n\r\n- You see flashing red lights\r\n- The crossing gate is lowered\r\n- There is a stop sign\r\n- You see a passenger train hurtling towards you and/or hear a loud af train horn\r\n\r\nOkay, those weren’t the exact words of the Federal Railroad Administration, but basically.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve paid attention to everything we just said, then congratulations. You’ve completed railroad crossing training. Remember: watch out for high-speed trains, listen up for locomotive horns and follow warning signs. If you can do all that, then you’ll be golden.

Here are a few regulatory traffic signs that you’ll see on your commutes, some a little more often than others. Lemme break ‘em down so you know what to do when you see ‘em.\r\n\r\n  Regulatory Traffic Signs\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"keep right of median or obstruction if you see this regulatory traffic sign\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/KeepRightofMedianQuestion-copy.png\"]\r\n\r\nKeep Right Sign\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n This sign, keenly named the Keep Right sign, lets you know that the highway will soon be divided by a median or that you will have to keep to the right to avoid an object/obstruction. Make sure you stay alert so you don’t hit whatever is coming up on your left.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"Do Not Enter regulatory traffic sign means do not go that way\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/DoNotEnter-copy.jpeg\"]\r\n\r\nDo Not Enter Sign\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n Hey, hey, hold up! Where you tryna go? Obvs not that way. When you see this sign, the road ahead is for one-way traffic traveling in the opposite direction. Going that way leads to… dun dun dun… certain death.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"yield is a regulatory sign that means yield right of way\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/YieldSigns-copy-e1466448335191.png\"]\r\n\r\nYield Sign\r\n----------\r\n\r\n You’ll see this sign a lot, so pay extra special attention. It tends to show up when one road joins another. If this happens and this sign is pointed at you, you’ll have to yield right-of-way to the vehicles on the other road.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"school speed limit is a regulatory sign that wants you to slow down in school zones\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/SchoolSpeedLimit-copy.jpeg\"]\r\n\r\nSchool Zone Speed Limit Sign\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\n This sign is activated by the light on the top. If you don’t see it flashing, feel free to follow the posted speed limit, but be aware that you are still traveling by a school zone. If the yellow light is flashing, it’s very important that you follow the speed limit it says. Be extremely careful while driving and make sure you’re keeping an eye out for children.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"red light photo enforced is a sign that tells you you will get a ticket if you run a red light\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/Red-light-camera-copy.jpeg\"]\r\n\r\nRed Light Photo Enforced Sign\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nYou’ll see this sign at intersections. It means that if you run a red light, there’s a camera that will take a picture of you. Then, you’ll get a hefty ticket you’ll have to pay sent to your house complete with a nice picture of yourself breakin’ the law. \r\n\r\nBe sure to check out our other [traffic sign posts](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/warning-signs-you-should-know-about/) so you can be prepared on the road."

They could be marking rails on either side of the road, placed before narrow bridges, or anywhere else drivers need to be reminded where the edges of the street are. This is pretty helpful during the night on roads that are poorly lit.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"drive carefully around trucks\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/Trucks-entering.jpeg\"]\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Truck Zone.\r\n\r\nTruck Warning Sign\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nWatch out, you’re in truck country now. This street sign wants you to be aware that large trucks tend to use the road that you’re traveling on. No big deal. Just remember to give these big guys plenty of space, stay out of their blind spots (which are really big and sometimes called No-Zones), and don’t cut them off. You know, the [usual good driver behaviors](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/defensive-driving-basics/).\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"the road is about to get narrower src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/RoadNarrowsQuestion.png\"]\r\n\r\nThings are about to get cozy.\r\n\r\nRoad Narrows Sign\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThis sign lets you know (surprise, surprise) that the road you’re on is going to get narrower. You can continue driving on it, and there may not be a reduction in the number of lanes if it’s a multi-lane road, but the lanes are going to get a little smaller. Just stay focused, reduce your speed, and pay extra attention to maintaining a bubble of space around your vehicle. This may not be a good time for passing other cars.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"road sign indicating a change in pavement\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/PavementChangeQuestion.png\"]\r\n\r\nKeep it together, because this road is falling apart.\r\n\r\nPavement Change Sign\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nLet’s be honest, this one is weird-looking. It doesn’t mean that you’re about the drive off the edge of the road and into a giant ball pit. That sounds exciting, but what this sign actually means is that the [pavement surface](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/right-of-way-different-pavement-surfaces/) is going to change. Specifically, it’s going to change from regular smooth asphalt to a rougher material, such as dirt, stones, or mulch. Rough roads like these can be harder to drive on, so you’ll want to slow down and proceed carefully to prevent losing tire traction.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"dont drop off the road onto the shoulder\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2016-06-17-at-1.13.20-PM.png\"]\r\n\r\nA sign that you're livin' life on the edge.\r\n\r\nShoulder Drop-Off Sign\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nBe careful, or this road is gonna drop you off at Crashville. Okay, that was bad. But really, pay attention when you see a sign like the one above. It means there’s a drop-off from the edge of the pavement to the shoulder. If you need to pull over on the shoulder (emergencies only, please), do so slowly and carefully.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"road sign in Asia\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/images.jpeg\"]\r\n\r\nCreatures crossing!\r\n\r\nLast of all, this sign (probably) means you should watch out for exotic cats."

If there are any legal fees associated with property damage, this insurance coverage can help pay for those, too.\r\n\r\nDon’t Take It Personally\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n**Personal Injury Protection** is sort of like Bodily Injury coverage in that it helps pay for medical expenses after a car collision. The difference is that Personal Injury is a no-fault insurance coverage, which means that it helps you out regardless of who caused the accident. Personal Injury Protection can be super-duper useful because often insurance companies take a long time to determine who is at fault for the accident. With Personal Injury you can get covered immediately and not have to worry about going through someone else’s insurer, either.\r\n\r\nI Somehow Find You And I Collide\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Collision Coverage** is there to protect your car when you don’t (cause you crashed it, oops). While Property Damage covers other vehicles and objects involved in the accident, Collision helps make sure that your own car gets repaired or replaced.\r\n\r\nFor Everything Else There’s ...\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Comprehensive Coverage.** While Collision and Comprehensive both help pay for damages to your car, comprehensive works specifically to cover environmental impact, like rockslides, fire and other natural disasters. Comprehensive also helps pay in the event that your car is vandalized or stolen.\r\n\r\nAre You (In)Sure?\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n**Uninsured Motorist** helps you pay for an accident if another driver is uninsured or underinsured. Basically, it’s possible that another person could cause the car wreck, but not have the means to pay for it (ugh). Uninsured Motorist helps protect against that. In addition, underinsured motorist coverage can help pay for damages and bodily injury if you get involved with a hit-and-run driver.\r\n\r\nCan I Borrow You?\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nWhen you go to Enterprise-Rent-A-Car or another car rental company, the salesperson might offer you **rental insurance**. Car rental companies often offer several optional coverages that can range from a few bucks to about $20 a day. The only one you really need is the **collision damage waiver**, which helps you pay for damages, theft, towing and maintenance fees. The other coverages offered are usually just upsells.\r\n\r\nHelp, I Need Somebody\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n**Roadside Assistance** is coverage that rescues you if your car breaks down on the interstate. It can help pay for towing, flat tires, repair shop labor, jump-starting a battery, gas and oil delivery and locksmith fees. Roadside Assistance is basically the same as AAA, so if you already have one, you most likely don’t need the other.\r\n\r\nFeel more financially aware of car collision cost? Good. Now make sure you’re insured so that you can protect yourself if (heaven forbid) you get into a car wreck."

When your car stalls, it means the engine has died, which can be a really frustrating and even scary experience. In fact, your car engine can even stop running ***while*** you’re driving. But don’t panic, because we’re here to thoroughly prepare you for a car engine stall in the event it ever happens.\r\n\r\n**Why is my car stalling?**\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nSo what causes car stalling problems? Car engines quit because of a variety if issues around air flow, fuel or mechanics. Some common reasons for motor vehicle stalls include:\r\n\r\n- An empty gas tank\r\n- A fuel mixture that isn't rich enough (this is usually the cause of cold stalling and intermittent stalling)\r\n- A faulty fuel pump, alternator or EGR valve\r\n- A dead battery\r\n- A dirty air filter that's preventing good airflow\r\n- Low fuel pressure (if your car only stalls on inclines this may be the case)\r\n- Problems with releasing the clutch (manual transmission vehicles only)\r\n- Coolant sensor reading hot\r\n- Ignition related problems such as loss of spark\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"reasons for engine stall\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/reasons-for-engine-stall-1024x683-1.jpeg\"]\r\n\r\n**Stalling in Manual vs Automatic Transmission Vehicles**\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Automatics \r\n\r\nAutomatic vehicles use what’s called a torque converter to manage transmission fluid and keep your engine running while at a stop. If your torque converter fails, the engine can stall out. Torque converters can fail for many reasons, including dirty fluid, overheating and problems with stall speed, which is the RPM at which your torque converter shifts power from the engine to the automatic transmission. In order to check your torque converter, you might have to perform a stall-speed test. Here’s how:\r\n\r\n1\\. First, find out what your car’s RPM ***should*** be in the car's manual, then locate your tachometer (a tool that measures RPM).\r\n\r\n2\\. Place immobilizers behind your wheels to prevent your car from moving. Crank that parking brake. (Then crank that Soulja Boy.)\r\n\r\n3\\. Press the foot brake all the way to the floor and start your engine. Vroom, vroom. Change gears from park to drive, but instead of hitting the gas pedal, do not take your foot off the brake. We repeat: **do not take your foot off the brake!**\r\n\r\n4\\. Keep pressing the brake pedal, but use your other foot to engage the accelerator pedal for a maximum of five seconds. Check your tachometer for the stall speed and see if it reads lower than it should be. When you're done, be sure to remove your foot from the accelerator pedal first, then the brake pedal. Then you're safe to crank the parking brake back down.\r\n\r\n5\\. If you need to get a new torque converter, visit an auto shop. Or, if this whole process sounds like something you totally want to avoid, just head to a mechanic and ask them about performing a stall-speed test for you. They can make a recommendation on whether or now you need a new torque converter.\r\n\r\n### Manuals\r\n\r\nIf you have a **manual transmission**, your car is more likely to stall. Why? Because with a stick shift, it’s all about that clutch. If you forget to engage the clutch or switch into the neutral gear when stopping, you can cause the engine to stall.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"engine stall manual transmission\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/Engine-stall-stick-shift-1024x683-1.jpeg\"]\r\n\r\n**What Happens When Your Car Stalls?**\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf the engine quits while you’re driving, the car will first lose power steering and then power brakes. Your first course of action should be to apply the foot brake and steer gradually over to the side of the road. Then, turn on your hazard lights and try to restart your car. If you can't restart it, call an auto mechanic or friend with jumper cables for help. If the jumper cables don't do the trick in rebooting your stalled engine, you may be looking at another problem that requires repair work.\r\n\r\nIf your engine stalls while your car is at an idle speed (idling means you're sitting still), you might not be able to steer it to the side of the road. If this happens, turn on your hazard lights and call either the police or roadside assistance to help you safely get your car out of the road. Be sure not to get out of your car and try to push it while you're in traffic. Your safety should be the number one concern!\r\n\r\nIf your engine stalls out, use this information so you know what's happening, and how to handle it. With your newfound knowledge, you’ll be able to diagnose the problem whether you have an automatic or manual transmission, and explain to your mechanic what's going on.\r\n\r\nCan natural disasters make my car stall?\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe all know that secondhand smoke and smoke from forest fires can wreak havoc on the human body. The effects on a car are also similarly disastrous, though in the case of a vehicle, it requires a large volume of smoke and debris to see negative effects.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"can wildfire smoke cause engine stall?\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/wild-fire-engine-stall-1024x576-1.jpeg\"]\r\n\r\nPeople have [questioned](https://www.quora.com/Could-a-forest-fire-cause-the-engine-of-a-car-passing-through-the-affected-area-to-stall-by-heating-the-local-air-or-consuming-its-oxygen) the effects of smoke on cars and how it could create stalling in the past, but it seems that a surge in debris-filled smoke has caused the car issues to increase. There could be a few different reasons why a vehicle may stall out during a natural disaster, but all of them are indeed smoke-related, mostly in regards to oxygen intake.\r\n\r\nThe engine of a car can overheat due to smoke’s oxygen suck, leaving its cooling system unable to properly process the engine’s heat. It might not stall immediately, but as the oxygen flowing in decreases, the vehicle may slow down and eventually stop. This process [starves](https://www.yourmechanic.com/article/what-causes-a-car-to-stall) your car of fuel, which is what makes it move forward.\r\n\r\nIf you’re trying to drive through a fire, there’s a particularly high chance of a car stalling, with the vehicle’s air filter getting clogged due to ash, smoke, and debris. A clogged air cleaner will reduce the car’s intake of air and reduce the desired effects and operations of the engine. Clogged air filters/cleaners can cause stalling, misfires, loss of power, overheating or engine smoke.\r\n\r\nIt’s of the utmost importance that you remain safe during a fire. Make sure that you’re evacuating the area quickly, remaining prepared, and observing the effects of a disaster on your car, but more importantly, your health."

But when your power steering goes out, you'll need to know how to react. Let’s talk about what to look for/do if your power steering fails when you’re driving.\r\n\r\n If you’re turning your wheel and you hear noises, such as a whining sound, your power steering system pump could be seeeriously low on fluid.\r\n\r\nHow to Check for Power Steering Failure\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHere’s how you can check for leaks: Let your car sit for a while, maybe overnight, on a cleanish area (as clean as a driveway/street can be). When you go to drive it again, check and see if there’s a leak underneath it. If the color of it is amber, pink, or red, it could be a power steering fluid leak. Your car might also have a vehicle warning light for when you have a power steering issue, so be sure to check your dashboards for any irregular lights.\r\n\r\nWhat to do:\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nSo what do you do if your power steering goes out while you’re driving? Don't panic.\r\n\r\nListen up. If you’re in a busy area, warn other drivers you’re having driving difficulties by turning on your flashers and (if you feel like it’s necessary) honking your horn. Even though it might be difficult to do without power steering, use those muscles and move your car over to the side of the road.\r\n\r\nWhen you get to the side of the road, stop completely and try to turn your wheel. Does it move freely? It’s probably not your power steering. Is it difficult to turn? It’s probably your power steering. You either drive slowly (flashers on) to the mechanic or stay there and wait for a tow truck.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"Ripping off steering wheel will not fix power steering failure issue\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/mike-tyson.gif\"]\r\n\r\nRipping off steering wheel will not fix power steering issue"

Let’s go over the **potential and immediate emergencies** that can happen while you’re operating a vehicle so that you know exactly ***why*** it’s so important to be safe on the road.\n\nHead-on Collision\n-----------------\n\n**Potential Scenario:** You’re driving while looking at your phone when all of a sudden -- ***BLAM*** *--* you run straight into another car. Head-on collisions can be life-threatening, especially if you’re driving fast. Avoid them by paying attention to your surroundings and never driving while distracted!\n\n![head-on-collision](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/crash-test-1620603_1280.jpg) Head-on collisions can be fatal.\n\nFront of Vehicle With Stationary Object\n---------------------------------------\n\n**Potential Scenario:** Much like a head-on collision, hitting a stationary object is easy to do if you’re not fully focused on driving, and instead looking at your phone or the radio. Stay alert so that you don’t veer off the road and hit a tree, light pole or railing.\n\n![car-crash](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/crash-1308575_1280.jpg) Running into a stationary object can be just as dangerous as a collision.\n\nDriving Off Road\n----------------\n\n**Potential Scenario:** You’re cruising along, perhaps a little sleepy, when suddenly your eyelids close and your car drifts off the road. Without control over your steering wheel, your car could flip over or hit a stationary object. If you’ve learned anything from scenario 2, this is no bueno.\n\n![driving-off-road](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mission-172702_1280.jpg) That is not where you belong, car.\n\nRollover\n--------\n\n**Potential Scenario:** You’re racing 25 mph over the speed limit on a bumpy road when -- ***THUMP*** *--* you hit a pothole and your car rolls over. Think this seems far-fetched? About 40 percent of fatal rollovers involve excessive speeding. Bumpy roads and potholes certainly don’t help.\n\n![rollover](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/car-1721724_1280.jpg) Stop, drop and (don't) rollover.\n\nBroadside Collision\n-------------------\n\n**Potential Scenario:** You’re at a four-way stop, and instead of waiting your turn, you roll right through the stop sign and collide with the side of another moving vehicle. Follow traffic signals and be aware of what other drivers are doing to avoid this situation.\n\n![broadside-collision](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/car-wreck-1618179_1280.jpg) Hello from the (broad)side.\n\nRear-end Collision\n------------------\n\n**Potential Scenario:** A car in front of you slows down, brakes and stops for a red light, but you’re too busy talking on the phone to see what’s happening. Instead, you run right into the stopped car. ***CA-CHUNK.*** That’s never a sound you want to hear.\n\n![rear-end-collision](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/crash-test-1620591_12801.jpg) Pain in the rear.\n\nSideswipe Collision\n-------------------\n\n**Potential Scenario:** You’re trying to pass a car on a narrow road when -- ***SCREEEKKK*** -- you scrape against said car and in the process knock off its side mirror. Easy fix? Give yourself enough space when passing and don’t cross into another lane!\n\n![sideswipe-collision](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/headlamp-2940_1280.jpg) (Side)Swiper, no swiping!\n\nNow that you know what these potential emergency situations look like, do your best to avoid them.

Because it's the law.\r\n\r\n What is Implied Consent?\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nSo you’re driving around after having a couple of drinks (something you definitely **shouldn’t** be doing because it's illegal and very dangerous) when you get pulled over by a police officer.\r\n\r\nYou’ve got the best idea. You’ll just say no to the breathalyzer and then they can’t get you for drunk driving because there’s no proof you were drunk, right? Completely wrong. Let us tell you a little bit about alcohol and drug testing laws.\r\n\r\nImplied consent means that once you step foot inside a car and start it up as the driver, you are accepting an implied contract to take an alcohol or confirmatory drug test if a police officer thinks it’s necessary. It's is implied acceptance of the law. It’s kind of like when people time travel into the past to change the future but they can’t change it cause the actions they’re creating in the past are already included in the future, you know?\r\n\r\nConsent laws state that the police cannot force you to take a sobriety test unless you cause a serious collision, but a refusal of the test has it’s own set repercussions.\r\n\r\nPenalties of Refusal\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nSo what are the penalties of refusing to take an alcohol or drug test?\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter what your BAC (blood alcohol content) is or whether you're intoxicated or not. You will be found guilty of violating “implied consent” and you can still be charged with a [DUI](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/cost-of-a-dui/), even without the breath test/blood test/urine test/chemical test, because you are under the law of implied contract.\r\n\r\nThe police officer will follow a set of mandatory guidelines and will give you a notice of proposed revocation or revoke your license and issue you a temporary permit in its place - bye bye, driving privilege.\r\n\r\nYour license will be suspended for 180 days unless you request a court hearing first.\r\n\r\n- If you have previously been charged for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and you refuse an alcohol/drug test, the license suspension will be lengthened to two years.\r\n \r\nAll these sound super fun, right? Wrong-o. Basically, you can get all of the benefits of a DUI + some extras bonus things, like an immediately suspended license. What I’m trying to say is, don’t drive after drinking. It’s bad news for you and everyone around you. And you can’t escape your fate, even if you time travel."
