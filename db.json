Here are a few regulatory traffic signs that you’ll see on your commutes, some a little more often than others. Lemme break ‘em down so you know what to do when you see ‘em.\r\n\r\n  Regulatory Traffic Signs\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"keep right of median or obstruction if you see this regulatory traffic sign\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/KeepRightofMedianQuestion-copy.png\"]\r\n\r\nKeep Right Sign\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n This sign, keenly named the Keep Right sign, lets you know that the highway will soon be divided by a median or that you will have to keep to the right to avoid an object/obstruction. Make sure you stay alert so you don’t hit whatever is coming up on your left.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"Do Not Enter regulatory traffic sign means do not go that way\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/DoNotEnter-copy.jpeg\"]\r\n\r\nDo Not Enter Sign\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n Hey, hey, hold up! Where you tryna go? Obvs not that way. When you see this sign, the road ahead is for one-way traffic traveling in the opposite direction. Going that way leads to… dun dun dun… certain death.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"yield is a regulatory sign that means yield right of way\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/YieldSigns-copy-e1466448335191.png\"]\r\n\r\nYield Sign\r\n----------\r\n\r\n You’ll see this sign a lot, so pay extra special attention. It tends to show up when one road joins another. If this happens and this sign is pointed at you, you’ll have to yield right-of-way to the vehicles on the other road.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"school speed limit is a regulatory sign that wants you to slow down in school zones\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/SchoolSpeedLimit-copy.jpeg\"]\r\n\r\nSchool Zone Speed Limit Sign\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\n This sign is activated by the light on the top. If you don’t see it flashing, feel free to follow the posted speed limit, but be aware that you are still traveling by a school zone. If the yellow light is flashing, it’s very important that you follow the speed limit it says. Be extremely careful while driving and make sure you’re keeping an eye out for children.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"red light photo enforced is a sign that tells you you will get a ticket if you run a red light\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/Red-light-camera-copy.jpeg\"]\r\n\r\nRed Light Photo Enforced Sign\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nYou’ll see this sign at intersections. It means that if you run a red light, there’s a camera that will take a picture of you. Then, you’ll get a hefty ticket you’ll have to pay sent to your house complete with a nice picture of yourself breakin’ the law. \r\n\r\nBe sure to check out our other [traffic sign posts](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/warning-signs-you-should-know-about/) so you can be prepared on the road."
