            "Body": "Traffic circles, sometimes called rotaries (if they’re large scale) or roundabouts, are a type of circular intersection. Yes, they’re round and strange and you might find them confusing at first, but remember: it’s just an intersection.\n\nIn addition to providing a nice little center island green space with shrubs to drive around, roundabouts, with their yield signs and low speeds, are actually safer than your average four-way intersection. They can also be way less confusing once you get the hang of them since every motor vehicle is turning in a clockwise direction. They're also much easier for large vehicles and emergency vehicles to navigate.\n\n**Who has the right of way?**\n-----------------------------\n\nIt’s pretty simple. If a vehicle is already in the traffic circle, they have the right of way.\n\nYou wouldn’t walk right up to a cashier and try to check out at the store if someone else was in the middle of getting their groceries scanned, right? Just wait your turn and everything will be great.\n\nIn some situations, there may be a traffic control device like a stop sign or stoplight at each entrance of the modern roundabout. If that’s the case, do what these traffic signals say. There will usually be some kind of roundabout guide like a pavement marking or sign at the entrances giving you an idea of how to proceed.\n\n![traffic circle](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lane-control-sign.png) Traffic circle lane control sign, courtesy California Department of Transportation\n\n**How do you drive in a traffic circle?**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nWhen you get to the traffic roundabout and see that it’s clear of other vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians, it’s time to join the circular party. Turn RIGHT, do not make a left turn. Traffic circles are basically one-way streets. A left turn into a roundabout would feel totally wrong, and you could end up in a head-on collision.\n\nContinue driving along the circle following traffic flow until you reach the street that you want to exit. If you’re in the interior lane of a really big circle, you will need to change lanes to exit. You'll always need to be in the right lane to exit. Simply merge onto the street of your choice. See? Not so bad."

Drinking and driving is one of the worst things a person can do. Find out how much a DUI could cost you (Spoiler: It will cost you more than just money.)\r\n\r\n Cost of Life\r\n------------\r\n\r\nIn 2013, in the state of Texas alone, there were 25,158 alcohol-related crashes resulting in 1,022 deaths. Over a thousand people had their lives cut short, many of them being innocent victims who paid the ultimate price for someone else’s mistake. Drunk driving often leads to terrible, irreversible consequences. It’s not worth the risk.\r\n\r\nCost of Freedom\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nIf you’re convicted of driving under the influence, life as you know it will get worse for a while. You could be assigned up to 100 hours of community service. You know what’s better than spending your Saturday mornings picking up garbage? Almost anything else. You could even get jail time. If you like having the freedom to wear, eat, and do what you want, avoid that jail life. Don’t drink and drive.\r\n\r\nFinancial Cost\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, DUI’s simply cost a whole lotta money. We’re talkin’ legal fees, fines, increased insurance premiums, and bail. The total bill can easily reach $10,000. That’s not even counting the money you’re missing out on via lost wages. Every day you spend in jail, doing community service, or going to court is a day you could have spent making money at work or just enjoying life."

Chugga-chugga, choo-choo.\r\n\r\n**Dinah, Blow Your Horn**\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nIf hear that train whistle, you know it’s time to S-T-O-P. When approaching a train crossing, you’ll often see advance warning signs. (But not always!) The most common warning sign is a big yellow circle with an “X” and the letters “RR.” No, the “RR” does not stand for RiRi.\r\n\r\nMe: Haha I can totally beat this train\r\n\r\nTrain:\r\n\r\nIf the train is already on its way, you might see flashing red lights. Like most other traffic signals in the world, red lights most definitely mean stop. Don’t try to gun it and zoom through the tracks. You’re not that good.\r\n\r\nIn the following situations, you must stop at least 15 feet in front of train tracks, according to the Federal Railroad Administration:\r\n\r\n- You see flashing red lights\r\n- The crossing gate is lowered\r\n- There is a stop sign\r\n- You see a passenger train hurtling towards you and/or hear a loud af train horn\r\n\r\nOkay, those weren’t the exact words of the Federal Railroad Administration, but basically.\r\n\r\nIf you’ve paid attention to everything we just said, then congratulations. You’ve completed railroad crossing training. Remember: watch out for high-speed trains, listen up for locomotive horns and follow warning signs. If you can do all that, then you’ll be golden.

Here are a few regulatory traffic signs that you’ll see on your commutes, some a little more often than others. Lemme break ‘em down so you know what to do when you see ‘em.\r\n\r\n  Regulatory Traffic Signs\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"keep right of median or obstruction if you see this regulatory traffic sign\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/KeepRightofMedianQuestion-copy.png\"]\r\n\r\nKeep Right Sign\r\n---------------\r\n\r\n This sign, keenly named the Keep Right sign, lets you know that the highway will soon be divided by a median or that you will have to keep to the right to avoid an object/obstruction. Make sure you stay alert so you don’t hit whatever is coming up on your left.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"Do Not Enter regulatory traffic sign means do not go that way\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/DoNotEnter-copy.jpeg\"]\r\n\r\nDo Not Enter Sign\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n Hey, hey, hold up! Where you tryna go? Obvs not that way. When you see this sign, the road ahead is for one-way traffic traveling in the opposite direction. Going that way leads to… dun dun dun… certain death.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"yield is a regulatory sign that means yield right of way\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/YieldSigns-copy-e1466448335191.png\"]\r\n\r\nYield Sign\r\n----------\r\n\r\n You’ll see this sign a lot, so pay extra special attention. It tends to show up when one road joins another. If this happens and this sign is pointed at you, you’ll have to yield right-of-way to the vehicles on the other road.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"school speed limit is a regulatory sign that wants you to slow down in school zones\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/SchoolSpeedLimit-copy.jpeg\"]\r\n\r\nSchool Zone Speed Limit Sign\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\n This sign is activated by the light on the top. If you don’t see it flashing, feel free to follow the posted speed limit, but be aware that you are still traveling by a school zone. If the yellow light is flashing, it’s very important that you follow the speed limit it says. Be extremely careful while driving and make sure you’re keeping an eye out for children.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"red light photo enforced is a sign that tells you you will get a ticket if you run a red light\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/Red-light-camera-copy.jpeg\"]\r\n\r\nRed Light Photo Enforced Sign\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nYou’ll see this sign at intersections. It means that if you run a red light, there’s a camera that will take a picture of you. Then, you’ll get a hefty ticket you’ll have to pay sent to your house complete with a nice picture of yourself breakin’ the law. \r\n\r\nBe sure to check out our other [traffic sign posts](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/warning-signs-you-should-know-about/) so you can be prepared on the road."

They could be marking rails on either side of the road, placed before narrow bridges, or anywhere else drivers need to be reminded where the edges of the street are. This is pretty helpful during the night on roads that are poorly lit.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"drive carefully around trucks\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/Trucks-entering.jpeg\"]\r\n\r\nWelcome to the Truck Zone.\r\n\r\nTruck Warning Sign\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nWatch out, you’re in truck country now. This street sign wants you to be aware that large trucks tend to use the road that you’re traveling on. No big deal. Just remember to give these big guys plenty of space, stay out of their blind spots (which are really big and sometimes called No-Zones), and don’t cut them off. You know, the [usual good driver behaviors](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/defensive-driving-basics/).\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"the road is about to get narrower src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/RoadNarrowsQuestion.png\"]\r\n\r\nThings are about to get cozy.\r\n\r\nRoad Narrows Sign\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThis sign lets you know (surprise, surprise) that the road you’re on is going to get narrower. You can continue driving on it, and there may not be a reduction in the number of lanes if it’s a multi-lane road, but the lanes are going to get a little smaller. Just stay focused, reduce your speed, and pay extra attention to maintaining a bubble of space around your vehicle. This may not be a good time for passing other cars.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"road sign indicating a change in pavement\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/PavementChangeQuestion.png\"]\r\n\r\nKeep it together, because this road is falling apart.\r\n\r\nPavement Change Sign\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nLet’s be honest, this one is weird-looking. It doesn’t mean that you’re about the drive off the edge of the road and into a giant ball pit. That sounds exciting, but what this sign actually means is that the [pavement surface](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/right-of-way-different-pavement-surfaces/) is going to change. Specifically, it’s going to change from regular smooth asphalt to a rougher material, such as dirt, stones, or mulch. Rough roads like these can be harder to drive on, so you’ll want to slow down and proceed carefully to prevent losing tire traction.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"dont drop off the road onto the shoulder\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2016-06-17-at-1.13.20-PM.png\"]\r\n\r\nA sign that you're livin' life on the edge.\r\n\r\nShoulder Drop-Off Sign\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nBe careful, or this road is gonna drop you off at Crashville. Okay, that was bad. But really, pay attention when you see a sign like the one above. It means there’s a drop-off from the edge of the pavement to the shoulder. If you need to pull over on the shoulder (emergencies only, please), do so slowly and carefully.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"road sign in Asia\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/images.jpeg\"]\r\n\r\nCreatures crossing!\r\n\r\nLast of all, this sign (probably) means you should watch out for exotic cats."

If there are any legal fees associated with property damage, this insurance coverage can help pay for those, too.\r\n\r\nDon’t Take It Personally\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\n**Personal Injury Protection** is sort of like Bodily Injury coverage in that it helps pay for medical expenses after a car collision. The difference is that Personal Injury is a no-fault insurance coverage, which means that it helps you out regardless of who caused the accident. Personal Injury Protection can be super-duper useful because often insurance companies take a long time to determine who is at fault for the accident. With Personal Injury you can get covered immediately and not have to worry about going through someone else’s insurer, either.\r\n\r\nI Somehow Find You And I Collide\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Collision Coverage** is there to protect your car when you don’t (cause you crashed it, oops). While Property Damage covers other vehicles and objects involved in the accident, Collision helps make sure that your own car gets repaired or replaced.\r\n\r\nFor Everything Else There’s ...\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\n**Comprehensive Coverage.** While Collision and Comprehensive both help pay for damages to your car, comprehensive works specifically to cover environmental impact, like rockslides, fire and other natural disasters. Comprehensive also helps pay in the event that your car is vandalized or stolen.\r\n\r\nAre You (In)Sure?\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\n**Uninsured Motorist** helps you pay for an accident if another driver is uninsured or underinsured. Basically, it’s possible that another person could cause the car wreck, but not have the means to pay for it (ugh). Uninsured Motorist helps protect against that. In addition, underinsured motorist coverage can help pay for damages and bodily injury if you get involved with a hit-and-run driver.\r\n\r\nCan I Borrow You?\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nWhen you go to Enterprise-Rent-A-Car or another car rental company, the salesperson might offer you **rental insurance**. Car rental companies often offer several optional coverages that can range from a few bucks to about $20 a day. The only one you really need is the **collision damage waiver**, which helps you pay for damages, theft, towing and maintenance fees. The other coverages offered are usually just upsells.\r\n\r\nHelp, I Need Somebody\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\n**Roadside Assistance** is coverage that rescues you if your car breaks down on the interstate. It can help pay for towing, flat tires, repair shop labor, jump-starting a battery, gas and oil delivery and locksmith fees. Roadside Assistance is basically the same as AAA, so if you already have one, you most likely don’t need the other.\r\n\r\nFeel more financially aware of car collision cost? Good. Now make sure you’re insured so that you can protect yourself if (heaven forbid) you get into a car wreck."

When your car stalls, it means the engine has died, which can be a really frustrating and even scary experience. In fact, your car engine can even stop running ***while*** you’re driving. But don’t panic, because we’re here to thoroughly prepare you for a car engine stall in the event it ever happens.\r\n\r\n**Why is my car stalling?**\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nSo what causes car stalling problems? Car engines quit because of a variety if issues around air flow, fuel or mechanics. Some common reasons for motor vehicle stalls include:\r\n\r\n- An empty gas tank\r\n- A fuel mixture that isn't rich enough (this is usually the cause of cold stalling and intermittent stalling)\r\n- A faulty fuel pump, alternator or EGR valve\r\n- A dead battery\r\n- A dirty air filter that's preventing good airflow\r\n- Low fuel pressure (if your car only stalls on inclines this may be the case)\r\n- Problems with releasing the clutch (manual transmission vehicles only)\r\n- Coolant sensor reading hot\r\n- Ignition related problems such as loss of spark\r\n \r\n\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"reasons for engine stall\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/reasons-for-engine-stall-1024x683-1.jpeg\"]\r\n\r\n**Stalling in Manual vs Automatic Transmission Vehicles**\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n### Automatics \r\n\r\nAutomatic vehicles use what’s called a torque converter to manage transmission fluid and keep your engine running while at a stop. If your torque converter fails, the engine can stall out. Torque converters can fail for many reasons, including dirty fluid, overheating and problems with stall speed, which is the RPM at which your torque converter shifts power from the engine to the automatic transmission. In order to check your torque converter, you might have to perform a stall-speed test. Here’s how:\r\n\r\n1\\. First, find out what your car’s RPM ***should*** be in the car's manual, then locate your tachometer (a tool that measures RPM).\r\n\r\n2\\. Place immobilizers behind your wheels to prevent your car from moving. Crank that parking brake. (Then crank that Soulja Boy.)\r\n\r\n3\\. Press the foot brake all the way to the floor and start your engine. Vroom, vroom. Change gears from park to drive, but instead of hitting the gas pedal, do not take your foot off the brake. We repeat: **do not take your foot off the brake!**\r\n\r\n4\\. Keep pressing the brake pedal, but use your other foot to engage the accelerator pedal for a maximum of five seconds. Check your tachometer for the stall speed and see if it reads lower than it should be. When you're done, be sure to remove your foot from the accelerator pedal first, then the brake pedal. Then you're safe to crank the parking brake back down.\r\n\r\n5\\. If you need to get a new torque converter, visit an auto shop. Or, if this whole process sounds like something you totally want to avoid, just head to a mechanic and ask them about performing a stall-speed test for you. They can make a recommendation on whether or now you need a new torque converter.\r\n\r\n### Manuals\r\n\r\nIf you have a **manual transmission**, your car is more likely to stall. Why? Because with a stick shift, it’s all about that clutch. If you forget to engage the clutch or switch into the neutral gear when stopping, you can cause the engine to stall.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"engine stall manual transmission\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/Engine-stall-stick-shift-1024x683-1.jpeg\"]\r\n\r\n**What Happens When Your Car Stalls?**\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf the engine quits while you’re driving, the car will first lose power steering and then power brakes. Your first course of action should be to apply the foot brake and steer gradually over to the side of the road. Then, turn on your hazard lights and try to restart your car. If you can't restart it, call an auto mechanic or friend with jumper cables for help. If the jumper cables don't do the trick in rebooting your stalled engine, you may be looking at another problem that requires repair work.\r\n\r\nIf your engine stalls while your car is at an idle speed (idling means you're sitting still), you might not be able to steer it to the side of the road. If this happens, turn on your hazard lights and call either the police or roadside assistance to help you safely get your car out of the road. Be sure not to get out of your car and try to push it while you're in traffic. Your safety should be the number one concern!\r\n\r\nIf your engine stalls out, use this information so you know what's happening, and how to handle it. With your newfound knowledge, you’ll be able to diagnose the problem whether you have an automatic or manual transmission, and explain to your mechanic what's going on.\r\n\r\nCan natural disasters make my car stall?\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nWe all know that secondhand smoke and smoke from forest fires can wreak havoc on the human body. The effects on a car are also similarly disastrous, though in the case of a vehicle, it requires a large volume of smoke and debris to see negative effects.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"can wildfire smoke cause engine stall?\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/wild-fire-engine-stall-1024x576-1.jpeg\"]\r\n\r\nPeople have [questioned](https://www.quora.com/Could-a-forest-fire-cause-the-engine-of-a-car-passing-through-the-affected-area-to-stall-by-heating-the-local-air-or-consuming-its-oxygen) the effects of smoke on cars and how it could create stalling in the past, but it seems that a surge in debris-filled smoke has caused the car issues to increase. There could be a few different reasons why a vehicle may stall out during a natural disaster, but all of them are indeed smoke-related, mostly in regards to oxygen intake.\r\n\r\nThe engine of a car can overheat due to smoke’s oxygen suck, leaving its cooling system unable to properly process the engine’s heat. It might not stall immediately, but as the oxygen flowing in decreases, the vehicle may slow down and eventually stop. This process [starves](https://www.yourmechanic.com/article/what-causes-a-car-to-stall) your car of fuel, which is what makes it move forward.\r\n\r\nIf you’re trying to drive through a fire, there’s a particularly high chance of a car stalling, with the vehicle’s air filter getting clogged due to ash, smoke, and debris. A clogged air cleaner will reduce the car’s intake of air and reduce the desired effects and operations of the engine. Clogged air filters/cleaners can cause stalling, misfires, loss of power, overheating or engine smoke.\r\n\r\nIt’s of the utmost importance that you remain safe during a fire. Make sure that you’re evacuating the area quickly, remaining prepared, and observing the effects of a disaster on your car, but more importantly, your health."

But when your power steering goes out, you'll need to know how to react. Let’s talk about what to look for/do if your power steering fails when you’re driving.\r\n\r\n If you’re turning your wheel and you hear noises, such as a whining sound, your power steering system pump could be seeeriously low on fluid.\r\n\r\nHow to Check for Power Steering Failure\r\n---------------------------------------\r\n\r\nHere’s how you can check for leaks: Let your car sit for a while, maybe overnight, on a cleanish area (as clean as a driveway/street can be). When you go to drive it again, check and see if there’s a leak underneath it. If the color of it is amber, pink, or red, it could be a power steering fluid leak. Your car might also have a vehicle warning light for when you have a power steering issue, so be sure to check your dashboards for any irregular lights.\r\n\r\nWhat to do:\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nSo what do you do if your power steering goes out while you’re driving? Don't panic.\r\n\r\nListen up. If you’re in a busy area, warn other drivers you’re having driving difficulties by turning on your flashers and (if you feel like it’s necessary) honking your horn. Even though it might be difficult to do without power steering, use those muscles and move your car over to the side of the road.\r\n\r\nWhen you get to the side of the road, stop completely and try to turn your wheel. Does it move freely? It’s probably not your power steering. Is it difficult to turn? It’s probably your power steering. You either drive slowly (flashers on) to the mechanic or stay there and wait for a tow truck.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"Ripping off steering wheel will not fix power steering failure issue\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/mike-tyson.gif\"]\r\n\r\nRipping off steering wheel will not fix power steering issue"

Head-on collisions can be life-threatening, especially if you’re driving fast. Avoid them by paying attention to your surroundings and never driving while distracted!\n\n![head-on-collision](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/crash-test-1620603_1280.jpg) Head-on collisions can be fatal.\n\nFront of Vehicle With Stationary Object\n---------------------------------------\n\n**Potential Scenario:** Much like a head-on collision, hitting a stationary object is easy to do if you’re not fully focused on driving, and instead looking at your phone or the radio. Stay alert so that you don’t veer off the road and hit a tree, light pole or railing.\n\n![car-crash](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/crash-1308575_1280.jpg) Running into a stationary object can be just as dangerous as a collision.\n\nDriving Off Road\n----------------\n\n**Potential Scenario:** You’re cruising along, perhaps a little sleepy, when suddenly your eyelids close and your car drifts off the road. Without control over your steering wheel, your car could flip over or hit a stationary object. If you’ve learned anything from scenario 2, this is no bueno.\n\n![driving-off-road](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/mission-172702_1280.jpg) That is not where you belong, car.\n\nRollover\n--------\n\n**Potential Scenario:** You’re racing 25 mph over the speed limit on a bumpy road when -- ***THUMP*** *--* you hit a pothole and your car rolls over. Think this seems far-fetched? About 40 percent of fatal rollovers involve excessive speeding. Bumpy roads and potholes certainly don’t help.\n\n![rollover](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/car-1721724_1280.jpg) Stop, drop and (don't) rollover.\n\nBroadside Collision\n-------------------\n\n**Potential Scenario:** You’re at a four-way stop, and instead of waiting your turn, you roll right through the stop sign and collide with the side of another moving vehicle. Follow traffic signals and be aware of what other drivers are doing to avoid this situation.\n\n![broadside-collision](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/car-wreck-1618179_1280.jpg) Hello from the (broad)side.\n\nRear-end Collision\n------------------\n\n**Potential Scenario:** A car in front of you slows down, brakes and stops for a red light, but you’re too busy talking on the phone to see what’s happening.

You’ll just say no to the breathalyzer and then they can’t get you for drunk driving because there’s no proof you were drunk, right? Completely wrong. Let us tell you a little bit about alcohol and drug testing laws.\r\n\r\nImplied consent means that once you step foot inside a car and start it up as the driver, you are accepting an implied contract to take an alcohol or confirmatory drug test if a police officer thinks it’s necessary. It's is implied acceptance of the law. It’s kind of like when people time travel into the past to change the future but they can’t change it cause the actions they’re creating in the past are already included in the future, you know?\r\n\r\nConsent laws state that the police cannot force you to take a sobriety test unless you cause a serious collision, but a refusal of the test has it’s own set repercussions.\r\n\r\nPenalties of Refusal\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nSo what are the penalties of refusing to take an alcohol or drug test?\r\n\r\nIt doesn't matter what your BAC (blood alcohol content) is or whether you're intoxicated or not. You will be found guilty of violating “implied consent” and you can still be charged with a [DUI](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/cost-of-a-dui/), even without the breath test/blood test/urine test/chemical test, because you are under the law of implied contract.\r\n\r\nThe police officer will follow a set of mandatory guidelines and will give you a notice of proposed revocation or revoke your license and issue you a temporary permit in its place - bye bye, driving privilege.\r\n\r\nYour license will be suspended for 180 days unless you request a court hearing first.\r\n\r\n- If you have previously been charged for driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs and you refuse an alcohol/drug test, the license suspension will be lengthened to two years.\r\n \r\nAll these sound super fun, right? Wrong-o. Basically, you can get all of the benefits of a DUI + some extras bonus things, like an immediately suspended license. What I’m trying to say is, don’t drive after drinking. It’s bad news for you and everyone around you. And you can’t escape your fate, even if you time travel."

The other 2% is enjoying black coffee and buying stocks or something, but that’s not what we’re talking about right now.\n\n Becoming responsible is particularly important at the point in your life when you’re getting your driver’s license. When your parents and/or the state allow you to have the privilege of driving, they’re trusting you to make good decisions behind the wheel. One of the worst mistakes a driver can make is deciding to drink and drive. Despite all the statistics and tragic stories related to drunk driving, people continue to do it. That’s why you need to actively plan to keep yourself and your passengers safe. Here are a few ideas:\n\n1. Choose Your Friends Wisely\n-----------------------------\n\nYour friends have a big influence on your lifestyle. They might be into drinking and act like drunk driving isn’t a big deal. These attitudes can rub off on you. That’s good ol’ fashioned peer pressure at work. Even if you stay committed to making safe and healthy choices concerning alcohol, the wrong friends just make life harder. How fun is it to take care of a bunch of drunk people? Not very. Don’t let deadbeats drag you down. Find some friends who are mature and driven by common goals, like getting better at a sport you both love.\n\n![Don't drink just because your friends do it](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/200-1-3.gif) Being different is the new “fitting in.”\n\n2. Make Your Decisions in Advance\n---------------------------------\n\nMaking decisions on the spot can be tough. You might panic or stumble and end up doing something you didn’t intend to do. Put some thought into your decisions. Don’t just let things happen to you. If you know that you want to get home from a party in your car (and not the back of a cop car), decide not to drink before you even go out. Your success rate at making the responsible choice will be better this way. Don’t wait to make up your mind until you’ve been lifted halfway into a keg stand.\n\n![Driving while intoxicated is stupid](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/giphy-26.gif) Make good choices.\n\n3. Adopt a Phrase\n-----------------\n\nOkay, so you’ve decided to be a decent human by refusing to drink and drive. That’s commendable! Now, how do you carry out the plan? One great option is to adopt a phrase for saying no to offerings of alcohol. “No thanks” will suffice. It’s clear and polite. You don’t owe anyone an explanation, but if you’d feel better having one, keep it at the forefront of your mind. It can be as true (“I’m scared of getting a DUI.”) or as made up (“I have to get up early tomorrow for a triathlon.”) as you want.\n\n4. Have a Backup Plan\n---------------------\n\nThere’s one more thing you should get straight before heading out to a party that might have alcohol or drugs. How will you get home if something goes wrong? If you make a mistake and end up drinking, don’t make a bad situation worse by driving home. If your friend who’s supposed to drive you home gets drunk, what can you do? Call a sober friend or relative for a safe ride. Maybe set up an amnesty program with your parents in case you get yourself into a dangerous situation and need to ask for help. Save a few phone numbers for taxi companies and download a couple of apps for ride-sharing services if they’re available in your area.\n\n![Find a safe ride home if you or your ride is impaired](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/giphy-2-17.gif) It’s always ok to ask for a safe ride.\n\nFollow these four tips to avoid peer pressure and drunk driving. Seriously, [you don't want a DUI](https://www.aceable.com/blog/defining-underage-dui-zero-tolerance-for-drinking-and-driving/) or DWI on your hands. Start making choices now that will help you build the future you want."

According to the NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration) nearly ONE THIRD of ALL deaths of 15-20 year olds are from motor vehicle crashes, and ONE THIRD of those deaths are alcohol-related. Not good.\n\nThe alcohol rate in young drivers is TWICE that of over-21 drivers. Even just a beer will put you and your passengers and everyone else out there on the road with you at a greater risk of being in a fatal crash.\n\nAnd even if you don’t die, or cause others death or injury, a DUI is a “per se offense” in legal terms. That means the police don’t have to prove you’re intoxicated as long as you’re above the limit. Which for YOU under-21-year-olds means a BAC of 0.01 or 0.02, depending on which state you live or are driving in.\n\nApart from the immediate costs (including public shame for you and your family), a DUI offense can reach far into your future.\n\n![from “Innocent to Incarcerated” 2011 campaign](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/NH03-29440YearPoster-lo.jpg) from “Innocent to Incarcerated” 2011 campaign\n\nTake a look at Isaac’s senior portrait -- he’s in the light blue shirt.

Scary prospect! An early drunk driving conviction will appear on any background checks for employment (kiss that summer job as a camp counselor goodbye) and your parents’ insurance rates will be astronomical until you turn 25 at least. A DUI can stay on your driving record for a good ten years, too. You’ll be ancient by then -- in your mid-20’s at least!\n\nDon’t even think about this NOT happening to you if you drink and drive. You might know someone right now at your school who’s got a DUI already.\n\nAnd don't be foolish: Your local police officers have known for years and years exactly where teens like to go to party in the woods or the fields, or try to buy alcohol. They just know these things. There are no safe places to hide. And they can tell from a football field away if you’re driving under the influence. (Author's note: My brother is retired CHP - CA Highway Patrol - he knew every drinking spot in his county!)\n\nFor you parents and older siblings who think it’s okay to buy alcohol to “drink safely at home,” your teen’s friends have to get home from your illegal house party at some point. What’s it going to feel like to get a call from one of those parents when their child has been involved in a drunk driving accident after they’ve been drinking at YOUR house? Sadly, it happens all the time.\n\n One last note: Zero Tolerance Laws also make it illegal to drive with any measurable amount of specified drugs in the body. It’s simple: if it’s illegal to possess, then it’s illegal to drive after you’ve used it. But that’s a whole ‘nother blog, fam.\n\n**ZERO DRINKING AND DRIVING. NADA! NIL! ZIP! ZILCH!**\n\n**GOT IT? GOOD!**"

            "Body": "Did you know that drowsy driving can be just as dangerous as drunk driving?! Drowsy driving might not seem like a big deal at first, but studies have shown that it's a much bigger problem than you might think. According to the CDC 1 in 25 adult drivers admit to having fallen asleep behind the wheel in the previous 30 days.\n\nAccording to The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, drowsy driving was responsible for 72,000 crashes, 44,000 injuries, and 800 deaths in 2013 alone. These numbers are even underestimated and up to 6,000 fatal crashes each year may be caused by inattentive driving from sleep deprived individuals.\n\nAccording to the AAA Foundation, drowsy drivers were involved in an estimated 21% of fatal automobile crashes in 2014. That crash risk rate went up from the estimated 16.5% from the previous study in 2010. With crash rates like that, how can you argue that risk factors like sleepiness, untreated sleep deprivation, and fatigue aren't risky driving behaviors?\n\n Storytime\n---------\n\nTeen driver: “I'm so happy the team won tonight! And I gave it everything I had, too! Feels awesome. Now there’s just this two-hour drive home before I can get some sleep. So pumped for this date with my bed. Yes.\n\nI wish there were somewhere I could grab an espresso or a Redbull…I’m so tired I can’t see straight … can’t stop yawning … here, let’s open the window a bit, turn up the radio, do something to keep myself focused…gotta get myself home … just another half hour to go … whoops, that was a bit sketchy … I veered onto the rumble strip …\n\nThe last thing I remember was the sound of my car scraping a wall on the freeway at 65 mph…I was real lucky…it could’ve been another car coming head on, or a tree or telephone pole. I don’t even **remember** driving the last few miles!”\n\n**The End.**\n\nYep. He was lucky. He lived. Like Ace says, drowsy driving is dangerous driving. Your reaction time is much slower, similar to drinking alcohol. Imagine if this story ended with a head-on collision instead of a jolt on the shoulder rumble strips and a close-call with a freeway wall.\n\nYou might be thinking \"Okay okay Ace, isn't it just truck drivers and late shift workers that have to worry about sleepiness-related accidents?\" Not at all! Over **55 percent of fatigue-related crashes** are not caused by long-distance truck drivers, but by MALES UNDER THE AGE OF 25. Yes, my young Acelet, that includes YOU!\n\nThe best rule of thumb to prevent drowsy driving is to not get behind the wheel at all when you’re tired. Or if you must, be sure you take along some very chatty friends. Better yet: let ‘em help you drive. Sleep loss can be dangerous behind the wheel- take a nap instead. Everyone likes naps.\n\nBe awesome and Aceable by avoiding driving crashes like this little guy.   \n ![Don't Drive Drowsy!](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/giphy-1-8.gif)"

            "Body": "So you think you can multitask while you’re driving? Trust us, it’s a BIG FAT MYTH!\r\n\r\nActually, it’s several myths, which we’re gonna bust wide open. We're sure your parents have already warned you about the dangers of distracted driving and, trust us, mother really does know best in this case.\r\n\r\nBut first, let’s let Ace test you:\r\n\r\n Not so easy to spot that purple suitcase, right?\r\n\r\nSure, talking and chewing gum at the same time IS easy. For one thing, you’re putting a thinking task (also called a cognitive task) with a non-thinking task. But talking and driving are both thinking tasks … it’s impossible for your brain to fully focus on both at the same time. One of these suffers, often with deadly consequences. Multitasking behind the wheel -- not cool. We get it. Sometimes we overestimate our own abilities. But trying to multitask while driving is dangerous no matter how coordinated you think you are.\r\n\r\nDriving researchers have completed lots of studies on this topic using both straight surveying techniques and naturalistic driving samples that view people over time to determine the level of distractions drivers face. He's some of the information they found out about distracted driving and transportation.\r\n\r\nWe have an unhealthy obsession with our cell phones, fam.\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nUsing cell phones and texting while driving is one of the most common distractions you'll see in the 21st century. According to a 2010 National Safety Council estimate, distracted drivers talking or texting while driving are four times more likely to be involved in car crashes and are involved in **21 percent of all crashes** in the United States. Just dialing a number takes as much of our attention off the road as talking or listening. Imagine how distracted you are when you're texting out an entire message to someone. The National Safety Council isn't conducting these studies for no reason, they want to decrease the number of crashes and increase driver safety. Let's help them with that cause, shall we?\r\n\r\nA 2012 driving study survey by the AAA Foundation of Traffic Safety reports that in the 30 days prior to that post, two out of three drivers admit having talked on their cell phones while driving at least once. It’s four years later now: Ya think that stat might have gone up a bit? This one’s even worse: one in three drivers actually admit to doing this “fairly often” or “regularly.” Go figure.\r\n\r\nOne myth is that hands-free cell phones are safer.\r\n--------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAccording to a recent Carnegie Mellon University study, a phenomenon called “inattention blindness” sets in when you’re listening, which blocks the same area in your brain that’s used for processing the movement of visual images - something that’s absolutely essential in order for you to drive safely.\r\n\r\nAs a new driver, you need all the brainpower you have.\r\n------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nLater on, with more experience, your brain will re-wire itself to do some stuff automatically, like:\r\n\r\n1. See a light turning red\r\n2. Foot hits the brake\r\n \r\nIn a 2008 NPR (National Public Radio) broadcast, Jon Hamilton talks about how multitasking teens might be muddling their brains. “Multitasking,” he says, “causes a kind of brownout in the brain … ALL the lights go dim because there just isn’t enough power to go around.”\r\n\r\nHe also says saying “no” to distractions depends in part on being able to control your impulses, which is something that’s not fully developed in a teenager’s brain. So when you’re driving, and you get a text message alert, your brain finds it hard to ignore and creates an impulse to start texting while driving.\r\n\r\nBest bet is to turn your phone OFF before you turn that ignition switch ON.\r\n\r\nYou want to argue that talking on a cell phone is just as distracting as talking to someone riding along with you? That’s also a myth.\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nOn a cell phone, there’s only one of you watching the road; your passenger buddy is your extra set of eyes and ears. Duh.\r\n\r\nHere’s one last myth we want to bust for ya.\r\n\r\nDrivers on cell phones still have quicker reaction times than those who’ve been drinking.\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nNOT!\r\n\r\nThe University of Utah did a study that proved that cell phone users actually had slower reaction times than drivers with a .08 BAC, the legal intoxication limit. Yeah, you read that correctly. Using cell phones while driving can make your reaction time slower than that of drivers under the influence of alcohol. That said, it's still SUPER dangerous to drink and drive too. Avoid both of these activities to avoid vehicle crashes.\r\n\r\nLike Ace says: Minimize distractions and bad driving habits! Be safe out there."

            "Body": "With so many things happening around you at once, it’s important to stay focused when you’re driving. Driving distractions can cause some serious issues when you're behind the wheel and lead to accidents. You want to make sure you're avoiding accidents that result in you having to file an insurance claim report, or in the worst case scenario hurting or killing someone. According to the NHTSA, 3,477 people were killed in auto accidents involving distracted driving in 2015 alone, and teens were listed as the largest group of those reported as distracted at the time of the fatal accident. That is such a sad statistic when you think about the fact that some smart, defensive driving could have prevents almost all of these deaths!\r\n\r\nDistractions come in all shapes and sizes. Audible distractions like loud music or sounds outside the car, visual distractions like phones or GPS', delicious distractions like crunch wrap supremes from Taco Bell. We want to make sure we address all of them so you know what's cool, and what's not behind the wheel. Here are our 11 driving tips and no-no's to reduce distractions and help you focus on the task at hand (driving, duh).\r\n\r\n 11. Wait for a red light before you attempt to do anything not driving-related. Take a sip of your coffee or change the radio station during these red light breaks. Maybe practice your whistling or your air guitar skillz. Just don't do it while you're operating the vehicle and you're in motion. Multitasking is a myth- it's impossible to fully focus on two things at once.\r\n \r\n10. Put away your laptop and tablet. This should be obvious, but definitely do not watch videos on your laptop while you drive. Like, for real.\r\n \r\n9. Keep Spot in a crate. I know it’s tempting to let him hang his head out the window and let his jowls flap in the wind, but it’s not safe for you or your pup if they're distracting you. Put them up before you start driving.\r\n\r\n8. No minivan parties. Keep your passenger count to a minimum and keep ‘em under control. As the driver, you’re the car czar - you should be enforcing seat belt laws and making sure your passengers aren’t being too loud and distracting while you're operating a vehicle.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/78e21940-549e-4791-ac33-58d4a737c618.jpg\" alt=\"Basically you\" style=\"width: 100%;max-width: 720px\" loading=\"lazy\" /> \r\n\r\nBasically you.\r\n\r\n7. Put the book away. Don’t read while you’re driving. That’s just crazy talk. Don’t worry, Jon Snow will still be \\[SPOILER ALERT - CONTENT REMOVED\\] when you get to your destination. This kind of distracted driving behavior can lead to auto crashes. Why would you changing risking it like that?!\r\n\r\n6. Get ready before you leave. Bae would rather you arrive safely than look good, trust us. Don't do your makeup in the car, or try to do your hair behind the wheel. Reduce distractions by allowing enough time to get ready before you get behind the wheel.\r\n \r\n5. Don’t rubberneck at traffic accidents. Sure, you *want* to see, but do you *have* to see? BOGO accidents aren’t actually a good deal.\r\n \r\n4. If you need to use a GPS to get around, set your destination before taking off and don't fiddle with the device while you're moving. This can reduce distractions and prevent you veering off the road and hurting yourself, passengers, pedestrians, other cars, and property.\r\n \r\n3. Settle on music early. Get those driving playlists ready to go so you don’t have to look for music or change songs while driving. Fiddling with car controls and radio dials while you're on the road can be a lot more distracting than you think.\r\n\r\n2. No eating. Eating is a huge distraction. It takes more than just one of your senses away from driving. If you feel a snack attack coming on, at least wait until you’re stopped at a red light. Preferably though, pull over and finish your snack or meal before getting back on the road. If you pull out a delicious snack and start eating when you're taking your driving test at the DMV, you'll definitely fail.\r\n \r\n1. DON’T USE YOUR CELL PHONE. Studies show that using your cell phone is the most distracting, most dangerous thing you can do when you’re driving. That phone call or text can wait 'til you reach your destination. You can help other drivers avoid distracted driving too if you're riding along as a passenger. Doing things like banning texting and driving from those you ride with, navigating for them or calling them out for bad behaviors can help keep everyone safer. By avoiding these things, you can become a better driver who’s ready for anything. Drive safe."

If you take a course like Impact Teen Drivers or Aceable, you'll learn all about the dangers of distracted driving. But a little refresh and some eye-opening numbers never hurt anyone. Keep reading to find out why distracted driving is actually the worst, and why there should be no texting, dialing cell numbers, taking selfies, putting on makeup, breakdancing, or whatever other crazy distracted stuff people do behind the wheel.\r\n\r\n The following activities increase the likelihood of crashing your vehicle:\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n- Talking or listening: 1.3x more likely to crash\r\n \r\n- Reaching for your device: 1.4x more likely to crash.\r\n \r\n- Dialing: 2.8x more likely to crash.\r\n \r\n- Texting: 23x more likely to crash.\r\n \r\n- Not listening to your friends at Aceable: 100x more likely to crash.\r\n \r\n[Car crash statistics](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/car-accident-statistics/) are scary, but luckily you can help reduce them. If you text while you drive, you’ll spend approximately 10% of your time driving outside of your lane. Obviously, you should be spending 100% of your time in your own lane. When you start to move outside of it, you start to risk hitting something, or someone.\r\n\r\nThink about it - you’re texting and not paying attention to the road. You slowly move to the outside of your lane without realizing it. Coming up, there’s a person changing out their flat tire on the shoulder. You look up, but it’s too late. Bam. A potentially fatal accident that could have so easily been avoided. According to the data regarding crashes by NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Administration), there were 3,477 traffic fatalities from accidents involving distracted driving in 2015. 3,477 fatalities that didn't need to happen.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"texting while driving can kill you\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/texting-while-driving.gif\"]\r\n\r\nTexting and Driving is Seriously Unsafe\r\n\r\nThe AAA Foundation found that distractions last an additional 27 seconds even after ending distracted activities. That's almost an additional half minute of increased car accident risk regardless of how long you're looking at your phone. It can wait, fam. Really. Teen drivers were also listed among the most likely to drive distracted, stating that some teen drivers are distracted up to 50% of their time behind the wheel. This is part of the reason that teen crashes are so prevalent. Driver distractions are totally not Aceable, and we know you're smart enough to be safe out there on the road and stay focused.\r\n\r\nYour goal while driving is to be as safe as possible. We're not going to say it’s an easy goal, but it is essential to ensure the safety of yourself and others. To make reaching this goal easier, eliminate distractions and stay off the phone until you get to where you’re going. Help us reduce the number of accidents and teens killed in these accidents. Be Aceable!\r\n\r\nWe know talking about this stuff is scary, but it's an important conversation to have. According to the NSC (National Safety Council), the involvement of distracted driving in fatal accidents is actually really underreported making people think it's not as big of an issue as it is. Help us reduce the number of accidents and teens killed in these accidents by holding yourself and other accountable. Say something. Spread awareness. Be Aceable!"

From the hottie sitting next to you in class to that new episode of Grey’s Anatomy on TV while you’re trying to study, distractions are capable of messing you up big time. But when driving, distractions aren’t just annoying, they’re deadly. Let’s talk about some of the biggest driving distractions so that you can be sure to avoid them.\n\n **1. Cell Phones**\n------------------\n\nOkay, this one’s a no-brainer. Time spent looking at your phone is time you’re not looking at the road, and not looking at the road while you’re driving is...problematic. Unless you have a hands-free system, don’t take calls while driving and wait until you’re not driving to text bae back.\n\n![Ted is distracted by tweets while driving.](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1463069677.gif) Don't slide into those DMs until you reach your destination, Ted.\n\n**2. Music**\n------------\n\nListening to music while driving is great and helps to pass the time, but sometimes music can be a big distraction. Fumbling with radio stations, trying to change the CD, or trying to hook up your AUX cord while driving takes the focus off your responsibilities as a driver and makes you a danger to yourself and others. Don’t like that new Drake song? Wait until you’re at your destination or a red light to change the station. But also, Drake is 100 always, so…\n\n![Drake hates distracted driving.](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/tumblr_n7wcwuWsj91skwsigo1_500.gif) Drake says don't touch that radio.\n\n**3. Friends**\n--------------\n\nNo, I’m not talking about Rachel, Ross, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, or Joey. Riding around with your friends is one of the best things about getting your license, but you have to be careful. The more people you have in the car, the more distracted you’ll be. It’s hard not to want to join the convo when your friends in the back seat are dancing and laughing and Snapchatting away. FOMO is real! But getting you and your friends to your destination is more important and that should always stay your main focus.\n\n![Don't let FOMO get you down and distracted.](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/giphy-20.gif) When you get to your destination there will be no mo FOMO.\n\n**4. Cigs**\n-----------\n\nSmoking is always a bad idea. It’s especially a bad idea when driving. Think about it...you have to take your hands off the wheel to light up, you can only use one hand to drive because that cig is in the other hand, and what happens if you drop it? You’re frantically searching around your seat and floorboard trying to find it before it burns you or your carpet. It’s not worth it!\n\n![Cigs--not worth it!](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/plStraF.gif) I would do what she says if I were you.\n\nDistracted driving is serious business. 1 in 10 fatalities are caused by a distracted driver.

If you park in an intersection, literally no one else can drive through it. Rude.\r\n- Do not park within 50 ft of a railroad track \r\n  - Trains are scary! Keep your distance.\r\n- Do not park in front of a fire hydrant \r\n  - You could actually be endangering lives by blocking access to emergency water.\r\n- Do not park in the opposite direction of traffic \r\n  - That’s illegal, boo\r\n- Do not park next to fire lanes/emergency exits \r\n  - Again, for obvious safety reasons\r\n \r\nAlso, be aware of signs permitting you from parking. These are pretty basic, but also very important rules. You never want to stop other drivers from being able to drive or put people’s lives at risk because of where you park. Just keep these no-go places in mind when you have to park and you’ll be just fine.\r\n\r\nIf you still need to figure out how to tame the mythical parallel parking beast, check out this [blog post.](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/parallel-parking/)"

Often these signs will have a speed limit posted along with a fine if you violate the warning.

Highway traffic is pretty much the bane of everyone’s existence, so just hang in there and you’ll be fine. It’s especially important to be alert in heavy traffic in case another motor vehicle brakes suddenly or wants to change lanes. Just because you’re moving more slowly, does not mean you can forgo the rules of highway safety. Continue to check your blind spots, use your turn signal and keep your hands on the steering wheel. Above all, avoid distracted driving and resist the urge to pick up your cell phone just because you’re bored.\r\n\r\nAt night\r\n--------\r\n\r\nAt night, it’s just plain harder to see. Be cautious and ***s l o w*** ***d o w n*** when it’s dark out. It’s also important to be extra good about using your turn signal when changing lanes. Because we can’t always make out the shapes of cars in the dark, using our lights properly becomes even more critical.\r\n\r\nIf there is something in your way\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\nMost interstate road conditions are not immaculate. You’ll see potholes, cracked pavement and uneven surfaces. Ugh. If the road in front of you looks a little rough, please reduce your speed and proceed with caution (it should go without saying that everyone in the car should have their seat belts on, too). Sometimes you’ll run into bigger obstacles on the highway -- like debris that’s fallen off a truck, busted tires, road kill or even an animal crossing the road. In each of these situations, you’ll want to decelerate to avoid damaging your vehicle or causing bodily injury to an innocent lil critter.\r\n\r\nIf you get behind a slower vehicle\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nSometimes you’ll get behind cars moving slower than horse-drawn buggies. Approach that situation like you would a red light: brake and slow down. While it’s annoying to be stuck behind a slow-poke, just be patient until the opportunity arises for you to change lanes and be on your merry way.\r\n\r\nRemember: Just because the speed limit says 75 mph, that doesn't mean you'll never have to slow down on the highway. Keep your eyes open and be aware of situations that might cause you to take it slow."

This is a shift you will definitely feel when you’re inside your vehicle.\r\n\r\nThe times this will happen is when you suddenly steer, brake, or accelerate. This might cause your vehicle to spin around its center of gravity, hence:\r\n\r\n![spinning out is a type of yaw](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/spin-out.gif)\r\n\r\nYaw happens during spin outs and fish tails, when you hit black ice or [hydroplane](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/hydroplaning/).

When you turn your car to the right, its weight shifts to the left. (And when you turn yourself around, you do the Hokey Pokey.) Although the body of your car transfers its load, the wheels of your car will remain safely on the ground. That’s because your car’s body is actually attached to the wheels by springs.

This is more noticeable the harder you brake. When you accelerate, your front end is lifted as your rear end drops. Same as braking, this is more noticeable the harder you accelerate. It’s especially noticeable when you’re stopped and accelerate suddenly. So that’s pitch! It’s a pretty simple thing that you encounter every time you drive.

Don't forget to use your turn signal so other drivers know you're coming. Following step two will ensure you don't accidentally merge into another vehicle!\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"how to merge check mirror\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/how-to-merge-on-the-highway-check-mirror-1024x683-1.jpeg\"]\r\n\r\nStep 3: Adjust your following distance\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAs you enter and the lane and become part of the traffic flow, make sure to adjust your following distance based on your speed and the speed of those around you. You might have to speed up or slow down a little to do this and make sure you're following at a safe distance. Don't forget to turn off your turn signal!\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"how to merge following distance\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/how-to-merge-following-distance-1024x651-1.jpeg\"]\r\n\r\nIf you follow these 3 simple steps, you'll be merging with ease in no time at all.

Aside from being giant vehicles that make frequent stops, they’re usually full of little humans who might walk out into the street.

Respectfully share the road with them, of course, but you only have to stop when the bus is stopped and in the process of loading or unloading students. You’ll know this is happening when the bus has its lights flashing. It may also have a stop sign extended out from the side of the bus. It doesn’t matter if you see children around the bus or not. If the lights or signs are in use, be ready to slow down and stop.\r\n\r\nWho Has to Stop?\r\n----------------\r\n\r\n- Vehicles behind the bus in the same lane or neighboring lanes going in the same direction as the bus\r\n- Vehicles going the opposite direction on the same street as the bus\\*\r\n- Vehicles on a cross street that intersects with the street where the school bus is stopped\r\n\r\n\\*Tip: If you’re on the same street as a stopped school bus going in the opposite direction, the type of divider or median will determine whether you have to stop. If directions of traffic are only separated by a yellow pavement marking or center turn lane, you will need to stop. If there is a physical barrier, such as grass, trees, or concrete separating your vehicle and the school bus, it’s okay to keep driving.\r\n\r\nWait Patiently\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nRemain stopped until the school bus starts moving again or until the bus driver signals for you to pass.

Especially when someone else is passing you. If you speed up, they’ll have to be in the other lane longer which puts everyone on the road in the danger zone.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Stay in Your Lane Until the other vehicle has safely passed you and returned to their rightful lane, just stay put. Unexpected maneuvers during this time can cause unexpected accidents.\r\n\r\nStep 3: Give Them Space Giving the other vehicle enough space to pass you safely is always a good thing. Give them enough space while they’re passing, and then continue to maintain a safe following distance. So to sum up, giving cars space is always a good thing. When bae says they want space, however...not so good.\r\n\r\nAnd there you have it. Follow these simple rules and you’ll be the real MVP of passing and letting others pass you. Yasss."

Simple enough, yes? If you have to switch lanes to get over to the right, make sure you signal to other drivers that you’re about to be a car on the move.\r\n\r\nStep 2: Signal Before You Turn\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nOnce you’re in the right lane, be sure and activate your turn signal at least 100 ft before you actually want to make the turn. This gives the cars behind you enough time to slow down so they don’t rear-end you. You know that would suck, so use that sig!\r\n\r\nStep 3: Check Both Ways\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nSo now you’re finally ready to turn. Great ... but you still can’t. Before you can turn, you need to be sure that there isn’t any traffic around that you may need to give the right-of-way. This especially goes for bicyclists.

Turning right comes with its own risks, but there are even more things you need to think about when turning left. We’ve got some simple steps to help you make every left turn safer.\r\n\r\n1. **Get in the left lane.**\r\n\r\nIf you’re on a multi-lane road and you’re not already in the left lane, use your turn signal and move over when it’s safe to do so. Don’t turn left from a center or right lane unless it has pavement markings showing that it’s a left turn lane.\r\n\r\n2. **Signal Your Turn**\r\n\r\nTurning without signaling is a fantastic way to make other drivers mad at you. Stay well liked (and well within the law) by turning on your left turn signal at least 100 feet before the big turn. Signaling just as you start turning isn’t helpful to anyone.\r\n\r\n3. **Yield**\r\n\r\nNext, make sure you check traffic before entering the intersection. Obey the signals and signs. Since this is a left turn, you have to look BOTH WAYS for oncoming traffic. Don’t just look for cars, though. Keep an eye out for motorcycles, bicyclists, and pedestrians too.\r\n\r\n4. **Turn**\r\n\r\nWhen it’s your turn, you should...turn. Turn into the left lane of the street you’re joining, but definitely keep to the right of the center line. You don’t want to find yourself driving on the wrong side of the road.\r\n\r\nWhat about when you need to make a right turn soon after that left turn? Sorry, friend. You still need to turn into the left lane, *then* signal and switch to the right lane to make the right turn."

            "Body": "A lot of different factors can affect your braking distance. Braking distance is a measurement of how far your vehicle travels during the time it takes to come to a complete stop once you hit the brakes. Your braking distance will be shorter (aka better) if your brakes and tires are in good condition. That means you should make sure your tires have the right air pressure level and [plenty of tread](https://www.aceable.com/car-maintenance/how-to-measure-tire-tread/).\r\n\r\nNo matter how nice or well cared for your vehicle is, the best indication of your braking distance will be your speed. Watch how a vehicle’s speed changes its braking distance.\r\n\r\nThinking Distance\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nThinking distance is the amount of time it takes for you to decide to hit the brakes, and then actually hit them. When you see a potential threat, sign, or traffic control on the road, you don’t break instantaneously. You may need a second or two to move your foot to the brake pedal. Reaction time can be slowed down if the driver is sleepy, sick, impaired, or distracted. Make sure you’re sober and alert every time you drive, because sometimes an extra second can make all the difference.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"braking distance\" src=\"https://ace.imgix.net/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/braking-distance-thinking-distance.png\" loading=\"lazy\" /> \r\n\r\nBraking Distance \r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nBraking distance is the time it takes for your car to come to a complete stop *after* you've hit your brakes. When you double the speed of your car, your braking distance quadruples. As shown below, every time you double your speed, you multiply your braking distance by four.

Yes, you’re in big trouble if you decide to beer-and-steer in any of the 50 states. DWI penalties will increase for impaired drivers who have open containers in the motor vehicle, but the Open Container Law pertains to much more than this obviously illegal activity.\r\n\r\n The Open Container Law\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nThis law states that you cannot have any open containers of alcohol in your vehicle. If you do, it's likely you'll get a container violation. Intoxicating liquor isn't the only no-no. This law means no liquor, beer, or wine. It doesn’t even matter whether your vehicle is moving or parked somewhere! \r\n\r\nAn alcoholic beverage cannot be in any seating area of the vehicle, meaning the laws also prohibit passenger's drinks from being open in the motor vehicle. (The one exception is that passengers in a limousine can possess and consume alcoholic beverages in the passenger areas of the vehicle.)\r\n\r\nWhat is an open container?\r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nThe word “open” applies to not only open receptacles containing alcohol, but to any container that has been previously opened or has a broken seal. Obviously, a Solo cup with beer sloshing around in it is illegal (and quite risky for your car upholstery). But re-sealed containers are still considered open containers by the law, so put down the plastic wrap. It won’t suffice to shove a cork back into a wine bottle.\r\n\r\nYou also can't put alcohol in a container that would normally be occupied by another liquid in order to conceal the contents. You're not fooling anyone. Throw away open alcohol containers on the premises instead of bringing them in your vehicle, or do the classy thing and leave remaining alcohol and beverage containers with the party host.\r\n\r\nPenalties for Violating the Open Container Law\r\n----------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nPunishments for violating the Open Container law and having an unsealed alcohol bottle in your possession include jail time, fines, and community service. It’s not worth it! Don’t get into your vehicle with any type of alcohol container with a broken seal, and don’t let a passenger do it either. \r\n\r\nAnd remember, an open container can make a DUI charge even worse for a driver: vehicle impoundment, extended jail time, and loss of auto insurance. Never ever drink and drive. It's the law. Never bring open containers from alcoholic beverages in your car. It's also the law.\r\n\r\nHow to Transport Alcohol Legally\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nLet’s start with a really important disclaimer. If you’re under the age of 21 years old, you should not be in possession of ANY alcoholic beverages, open or not. If you've been drinking at all, you shouldn't be transporting anything or anyone in a car. Period. Not on back roads, or public highways, or anywhere.\r\n\r\nIf you’re 21 or older, learn the best way to get from A to B when you want to BYOB. Keep unopened alcoholic beverages in the trunk! Even if the bottles or cans are factory sealed, the trunk is a better place for alcohol than just setting it on the floor of the passenger side or in the back seat. No trunk? If you drive a pickup truck, feel free to keep alcohol in the bed of the truck as long as it’s at least two feet away from the cab’s back windows (where passengers could potentially reach it). This is the best way to avoid getting a container charge for breaking open container laws. Have fun, and remember: no alcohol for the designated driver! Drinking and driving is dangerous and not what an Aceable licensee would do.\r\n"

From the hottie sitting next to you in class to that new episode of Grey’s Anatomy on TV while you’re trying to study, distractions are capable of messing you up big time. But when driving, distractions aren’t just annoying, they’re deadly. Let’s talk about some of the biggest driving distractions so that you can be sure to avoid them.\n\n**The top four distracted driving habits are:**\n\n- Cell Phones & Texting\n- Music\n- Friends\n- Smoking\n \n Cell Phones\n-----------\n\nOkay, this one’s a no-brainer. Time spent looking at your phone is time you’re not looking at the road, and not looking at the road while you’re driving is...problematic. Unless you have a hands-free system, don’t take calls while driving and wait until you’re not driving to text bae back.\n\n![Ted is distracted by tweets while driving.](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/1463069677.gif) Don't slide into those DMs until you reach your destination, Ted.\n\nMusic\n-----\n\n Listening to music while driving is great and helps to pass the time, but sometimes music can be a big distraction. Fumbling with radio stations, trying to change the CD, or trying to hook up your AUX cord while driving takes focus off your responsibilities as a driver and makes you a danger to yourself and others. Don’t like that new Drake song? Wait until you’re at your destination or a red light to change the station. But also, Drake is 100 always, so… ![Drake hates distracted driving.](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/tumblr_n7wcwuWsj91skwsigo1_500.gif) Drake says don't touch that radio.\n\nFriends\n-------\n\nNo, I’m not talking about Rachel, Ross, Monica, Chandler, Phoebe, or Joey. Riding around with your friends is one of the best things about getting your license, but you have to be careful. The more people you have in the car, the more distracted you’ll be. It’s hard not to want to join the convo when your friends in the back seat are dancing and laughing and Snapchatting away. FOMO is real! But getting you and your friends to your destination is more important and that should always stay your main focus.\n\n![Don't let FOMO get you down and distracted.](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/giphy-20.gif) When you get to your destination there will be no mo FOMO.\n\nSmoking\n-------\n\nSmoking is always a bad idea imo. It’s especially a bad idea when driving. Think about it...you have to take your hands off the wheel to light up, you can only use one hand to drive because that cig is in the other hand, and what happens if you drop it? You’re frantically searching around your seat and floorboard trying to find it before it burns you or your carpet. It’s not worth it!\n\n![Cigs--not worth it!](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/plStraF.gif) I would do what she says if I were you.\n\nDistracted driving is serious business. 1 in 10 fatalities are caused by a distracted driver.

When your car stalls, it means the engine has died, which can be a really frustrating and even scary experience. In fact, your car engine can even stop running ***while*** you’re driving. But don’t panic, because we’re here to thoroughly prepare you for a car engine stall in the event it ever happens.\r\n\r\n **Why is my car stalling?**\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nCar engines quit because of an air flow, fuel or mechanical issue. Some common reasons for motor vehicle stalls include:\r\n\r\n- An empty gas tank or fuel mixture with too much moisture\r\n- A faulty fuel pump, alternator or EGR valve\r\n- A dead battery\r\n- A dirty air filter\r\n- Low fuel pressure (if your car only stalls on inclines this may be the case)\r\n- Problems with releasing the clutch (manual transmission vehicles only)\r\n \r\n![No, not that kind of stall.](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/giphy-15.gif) No, not that kind of stall.\r\n\r\n**Stalling in Manual vs Automatic Transmission Vehicles**\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you have a manual transmission, your car is more likely to stall. Why? Because with a stick shift, it’s all about that clutch. If you forget to engage the clutch or switch into the neutral gear when stopping, you can cause the engine to stall.\r\n\r\n![How you feel when your engine stalls at a light](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/giphy-1-8.gif) How you feel when your engine stalls at a light.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, automatic vehicles use what’s called a torque converter to manage transmission fluid and keep your engine running while at a stop. If your torque converter fails, the engine can stall out. Torque converters can fail for many reasons, including dirty fluid, overheating and problems with stall speed, which is the RPM at which your torque converter shifts power from the engine to the automatic transmission. In order to check your torque converter, you might have to perform a stall-speed test.\r\n\r\nHow to perform a stall-speed test\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\n1. First, find out what your car’s RPM ***should*** be, then locate your tachometer (tool that measures RPM).\r\n2. Place immobilizers behind your wheels to prevent them from moving. Crank that parking brake.\r\n3. Press the foot brake all the way to the floor and start your engine. Vroom, vroom. Change gears from park into drive, but instead of hitting the gas pedal, do not take your foot off the brake. We’ll repeat: **do not take your foot off the brake!**\r\n4. Keep pressing the brake pedal, but use your other foot to engage the accelerator pedal for a maximum of five seconds. Check your tachometer for the stall speed and see if it reads lower than it should be.\r\n5. If you need to get a new torque converter, visit an auto shop. Or, if this whole process sounds like something you totally want to avoid, just head to a mechanic and ask them about performing a stall-speed test for you.\r\n \r\n![Yoooouuuu!](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/crank-dat.gif) Yoooouuuu!\r\n\r\n**What Happens When Your Car Stalls?**\r\n--------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf the engine quits while you’re driving, the car will first lose power steering and then power brakes. Your first course of action should be to apply the foot brake and steer gradually over to the side of the road. Then, turn on your hazard lights and try to restart your car. If you cannot restart it, call an auto mechanic or friend with jumper cables for help.\r\n\r\nIf your engine stalls out, use these tips so that you don’t feel scared or stuck. With your newfound knowledge, you’ll be able to diagnose the problem or find someone who can help."

Well, exactly the same way you would prepare for a chemistry test -- study, practice and if you don’t know the answer, always pick choice C. Let’s learn about vehicle brake systems so that you’re ready to deal with brake failure if it happens to you.\r\n\r\n Identifying Brake Failure \r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nStaying ahead of brake failure is super important. Knowing what kind of braking performance is normal and what isn't can help you identify problems early and fix them before you end up in a dangerous situation. Your brake system has a lot of moving parts you need to keep an eye on. Parts like a disc or brake rotor, caliper, brake pads, brake fluid, wheel bearings, brake drums, hubs, wheel cylinders and more. Here's what you need to look out for when your brakes brake, erm, break.\r\n\r\n- **Screeching, rubbing or grinding noises:** these are common signs that your brake pads need to be replaced because the lining is wearing down. Ignoring these signs could lead to more expensive repairs from damaged parts down the road (pun intended).\r\n- **Rumbling or shaking in your brake pedal or steering wheel:** this is a sign that something is wrong with your rotors and that there is some metal on metal acting going on. Get to the shop asap to avoid further damage.\r\n- **A burning smell coming from your tires**: this could be a sign of multiple issues. Typically it means two things are rubbing together that shouldn't be rubbing together causing unwanted friction. Get your car into the shop asap.\r\n- **Your brake warning light is on**: you car is talking to you. Listen!\r\n- **Loss of stopping power when pushing the brake pedal:** this can be caused by something called brake fade. Brake fade is caused by a buildup of heat and can affect both drum brake systems and disc braking systems causing your brakes to fail.\r\n- **Brake fluid on your tires:** This means you have a leak in your brake line. Leaks in brake linings are no joke and will cause your brake fluid to slowly leak from your car. Your brake system relies on this fluid to operate, to be sure to get this fixed right away if you notice leaking fluid.\r\n \r\nBrake-ing It Down\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nWhen brakes do their job right, it’s magical. How does pushing that little pedal make your 4,000-lb vehicle traveling at 75 mph come to a complete stop? Read on, curious learner.\r\n\r\nHydraulic Pressure\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n“Under Pressure” is not only a catchy song by Queen and David Bowie, it’s also what happens when your foot hits the brake pedal. You see, you have a hydraulic brake, meaning when you press down on it, the force is multiplied by a hydraulic fluid (also called brake fluid) composed of mineral oil or water. Your car’s hydraulic fluid level needs to be in check in order for your brakes to work, so we’ll go over how to check it later in this article.\r\n\r\nFriction\r\n--------\r\n\r\nHydraulic brakes aren’t the only “magic” that make cars stop. Friction plays an equally important role in the mechanics of your car brake. In fact, your brake contains parts that are composed of an anti-heat friction material, which helps create resistance and slow down your car. Let’s go over in more detail how hydraulic pressure and friction work together within your brake system.\r\n\r\n<img style=\"max-width: 380px;width: 100%\" src=\"https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Friction_diagram.png\" alt=\"Stranger than friction.\" loading=\"lazy\" />\r\n\r\nStranger than friction.\r\n\r\nBrake Types\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nMost cars have two types of brakes: drum brakes and disc brakes. Hydraulic pressure and friction are at work in both types, but the mechanics of drum and disc brakes are slightly different.\r\n\r\nIn drum brakes, hydraulic fluid moves from the brake pedal to a set of “brake shoes,” which are composed of that friction material we mentioned earlier. The brake shoes then press up against the brake drum and bring your car wheels to a halt.\r\n\r\n<img style=\"max-width: 380px;width: 100%\" src=\"https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/drum-brake4.jpg\" alt=\"Diagram from HowStuffWorks.com\" loading=\"lazy\" />\r\n\r\nDiagram from [HowStuffWorks.com](https://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts/brakes/brake-types/drum-brake.htm)\r\n\r\nIn disc brakes, brake fluid moves from the brake pedal to a brake caliper. The caliper contains two pads situated on either side of a brake rotor. When the brake pedal is activated, those pads get pressed together by a caliper piston. *Scrrrrrrttt* … and stop.\r\n\r\n<img style=\"max-width: 380px;width: 100%\" src=\"https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/disc-brake3.jpg\" alt=\"Diagram from HowStuffWorks.com\" loading=\"lazy\" />\r\n\r\nDiagram from [HowStuffWorks.com](https://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-parts/brakes/brake-types/disc-brake1.htm)\r\n\r\nDisc brakes are considered to be better than drum brakes because they are less likely to get overheated, which can cause brake problems or brake failure. Typically, cars have disc brakes in the front and drum brakes in the back. In this way, your brake system is much like a mullet: business in the front, party in the back.\r\n\r\nPhew. That was a lot of information about brakes. Now let’s take a break, shift gears and talk about what to do in the event of brake failure.\r\n\r\nCan’t Stop, Won’t Stop\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nBrakes not braking? Step by step here’s what to do:\r\n\r\n1. If you drive a standard car, downshift to a lower gear. If you drive an automatic car, the gears will lower as you decelerate.\r\n2. If you have regular brakes, pump the brake pedal fast and hard to build up hydraulic brake fluid pressure. Hey, we talked about that earlier! If you have antilock brakes, push the brake all the way down and hold.\r\n3. Use your secret weapon: the emergency brake. Gradually apply the parking brake and be prepared for your car to skid.\r\n4. If all else fails, steer into a safe direction (like away from other cars) until your car rolls to a complete stop. If you’re driving super fast on the highway, that might mean you have to create friction between your car and the guardrail to slow down.\r\n5. Make sure you honk your horn and flash your warning lights to let other cars know that your brakes aren’t working! Above all, try to stay calm and remember your defensive driving techniques. You can do this.\r\n \r\nTroubled Waters\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nYou’ve learned that your brakes need hydraulic fluid to work properly. Here’s how to check and make sure your brake fluid levels are enough to quench your car’s thirst. Gotta keep that baby hydrated.\r\n\r\n1. Open up your car hood and locate the master cylinder. The top part of the master cylinder is a brake fluid reservoir that looks like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://ace.imgix.net/uploads/sites/4/2021/01/Brake_fluid_reservoir_in_Škoda_Fabia_I-1.jpg?auto=format,compress\" style=\"max-width: 380px;width: 100%\" alt=\"Don't drink this, please.\" loading=\"lazy\" />\r\n\r\nDon't drink this, please.\r\n\r\n2. Check the fluid level in the reservoir by making sure it’s between the marks labeled “max” and “min.”\r\n3. You can also check the color of your fluid. It should be brown, so if it looks black, that could mean you need to change it.\r\n4. Add brake fluid if necessary or visit the nearest auto mechanic.\r\n \r\nThe easiest way to prevent brake failure is to keep up your [vehicle maintenance](https://www.aceable.com/car-maintenance/). Make sure you get an annual vehicle safety inspection and visit an auto shop if something feels “off” with your car. Regularly keep up with other preventative car maintenance like changing your oil, getting your tires rotated and replacing your windshield wipers and air filters. Make sure your car is nice and healthy so that you stay safe!"

Don’t panic. Your car just broke down, but it’s not the end of the world. As Rachel Platten would say, “Starting right now I’ll be strong.” Here’s how to handle a vehicle breakdown in four simple steps.\r\n\r\n 1. Pull Over\r\n2. Turn On Your Emergency Flashers\r\n3. Exit Your Vehicle Cautiously\r\n4. Find Your Location\r\n\r\nStep 1 - Pull Over\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nIf your car or engine starts smoking, sputtering or turns into a transformer, pull over to the right as far as possible. You need to do this for two reasons: 1) You gotsta be courteous to others on the road and get out of the way ASAP (don’t be that person who causes a traffic jam) and 2) You need to relocate to a safe spot where you can avoid getting hit by a moving vehicle. If your car dies before you're able to pull over, don't get out of the car in the middle of traffic. In this instance call roadside assistance or, if you don't have it, a police officer to help you. You don't want to chance getting hurt in the middle of a busy road.\r\n\r\nStep 2 - Turn On Your Emergency Flashers\r\n----------------------------------------\r\n\r\nAfter you pull over, you need to switch on your hazard lights, or emergency flashers, to make your vehicle clearly visible to other drivers. This says, *Hey! Look at me! Don’t hit me, please.* If your battery is dead and your lights aren't working, try hanging something out the window like a brightly colored T-shirt or piece of paper to alert oncoming traffic that something is wrong.\r\n\r\nStep 3 - Exit Your Vehicle Cautiously\r\n-------------------------------------\r\n\r\nIf your car is smoking, you probably want to get out of it. And by probably, we mean most definitely. When you exit your vehicle, be cautious and try to do so on the side opposite the road. Safety first, people. If your car seems to be okay and isn't showing any signs of smoke (dead battery, out of gas, etc.) feel free to just stay in the car with the doors locked while you await your tow truck or help from the police department. If at all possible, try to avoid walking away and leaving an abandoned vehicle on the side of the road and stay with your broken down car until help arrives. Don't try to make any repairs to your if there is heavy traffic.\r\n\r\nStep 4 - Find Your Location\r\n---------------------------\r\n\r\nLook around for any information that could help a tow truck or service vehicle find your location, such as exit signs or address signs. Also, this is why you have a smartphone, guys. Use dat Maps app. If you're one of those people with terrible luck whose car breaks down regularly, we recommend having the number for AAA or some other roadside assistance coverage saved to your phone for instances like these.\r\n\r\nIf you can remember these four steps than everything will be fine. Just because your car broke down doesn’t mean that you have to break down, too."

What the heck do you do now?\r\n\r\n[Car accidents](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/car-accident-statistics/) can be some of the scariest and most stressful moments for any driver. It’s important that you know to do after a car crash so you can remain calm and collected if you’re involved in one.\r\n\r\n  Steps to Take After a Car Crash\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\n1. First, you want to check for anyone who might have injuries. If there are injured people, call 911 immediately. Do not attempt to move anyone unless you are specifically trained. Even still, you will probably want to leave that for the paramedics, since you were just in a crash and might not be thinking correctly.\r\n2. Stay in control of the scene and make sure you’re visible to oncoming cars and motorcycles by turning on your hazard lights until the police arrive. Once they come they can put out warning triangles and traffic cones to alert oncoming traffic of the accident.\r\n3. Next, you’ll have the police file a report of the accident for your insurance company. Retrieve a copy of this report from the police before leaving the scene of the accident. It’s important to keep from admitting responsibility or fault to anyone (other drivers, witnesses, etc.) other than the police or the insurance claim agent. For legal reasons, you know. Be sure to take down the responding officers' names, the names of any witnesses or involved drivers, and the license plates of the damaged vehicles. You'll also want to take photos of any damage.   \r\n4. Next, you'll then need to contact your insurance company and speak with an agent to see what next steps should be taken. They should be able to walk you through insurance basics. Note: you should 100% not be driving without up-to-date car insurance. Driving uninsured is super illegal, and can result in even more trouble and some hefty fines if you're ever in a car accident. So whether you use Geico, Allstate, Esurance, State Farm, or some small mom and pop insurance company as your insurer, you'll want to contact them to let them know about the car accident and file a claim.   \r\n     \r\n   The claims process can be different with across various insurance providers and collision coverage levels, which is why it's important to call your agent and find out what steps you need to take after a crash. You'll usually have to pay some kind of deductible up front but could end up getting a reimbursement if you overpay for any reason. These amounts of payment all come down to the type of motorist coverage plan you have and the rates you receive.\r\n \r\nCrashes are traumatic for everyone involved. It’s important to stay calm, keep a level head, and be understanding when you’re in this situation."

Fortunately, programming like [drivers education](https://www.aceable.com) and graduated license laws (also called GDL laws) have decreased the number of teen drivers and passengers involved in car accidents and those that result in crash deaths in recent years, but there’s still more work to do. We don’t want to scare you away from driving, but we do want to keep you safe and away from crashes and accidents. Here’s some statistics about teen drivers' involvement in motor vehicle accidents and crash rates that you should know:\r\n\r\n**Teens Injured in Car Crashes**\r\n--------------------------------\r\n\r\nIn 2010, 282,000 teens were injured in car accidents. That’s about half the population of the state of Wyoming.\r\n\r\n![Well now, this is just upsetting.](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Wyoming_in_United_States.svg_.png) Well now, this is just upsetting.\r\n\r\n**Teens Killed in Car Crashes**\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\n[According to the IIHS](http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/t/teenagers/fatalityfacts/teenagers/2015) (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety), 2,715 teen drivers aged 13-19 (vehicle occupants) died in fatal crashes and motor vehicle accidents in 2015. To put this teen fatality statistic in perspective, the number of teens who were killed in car accidents in 2015 was greater than the number of people who died from airplane crashes, lightning strikes, shark attacks, skydiving, snake bites, tornadoes, spider bites and earthquakes **COMBINED!**\r\n\r\nThese teen crashes don't only impact the driver. [According to the AAA Foundation](https://aaafoundation.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/TeenDriverCrashes1994-2013Report.pdf), 371,645 people were injured and 2,927 were killed in crashes that involved a teen driver in 2013. This number includes the driver, the teen's passengers, drivers hurt or fatally injured in other vehicles, and pedestrians on the street. Be safe, and keep others safe.\r\n\r\n![Less scary than a car, Mr. Shark.](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Caribbean_reef_shark.jpg) Less scary than a car, Mr. Shark.\r\n\r\nThese statistics are part of the reason that auto insurance rates tend to be higher for young drivers. Companies like Geico, Progressive and State Farm take this information about crashes and accidents with teen drivers involved and raise their rates.\r\n\r\nWhile you should be aware of these teen driving statistics, there’s something you can do help change them. Pay attention in [drivers ed](https://www.aceable.com). Be safe on the road. Encourage your friends to be safe. Refrain from doing extremely dangerous things like drinking and driving, [texting and driving](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/the-myth-of-multitasking-while-driving-you-cant-do-it/), partaking in distracted driving, or [driving when you’re tired](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/cost-of-a-dui/). Be a [defensive driver](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/defensive-driving-basics/). Be a smart driver. Be a responsible driver who follows the rules and doesn't get distracted.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that the number of teenage motor deaths is going down! According to NHTSA (National Highway Traffic Safety Association), there has been a 53% decrease in fatally serious accidents for 14-19 year-olds between 2005 and 2014. Let’s work together to make teens safer on the road and keep reducing the number of drivers killed each year. We know we can do it!"

Maybe you’re a few seconds away from approaching a red light, which means you need to slow down and stop. No matter what’s ahead of you on the road, you need to be on the lookout -- and that’s where **visual targeting strategies** come into play. Not sure what that means? Don’t worry, your favorite drivers ed and defensive driving company is here to help. This is Visual Targeting 101, and trust us, it’s eye-opening (heheh, get it?).\r\n\r\nAs Far as the Eye Can See\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\nNow listen up children (and also teenagers and adult drivers and whoever else is reading right now), you're about to be taught drivers ed skills that will blow your mind. Okay maybe not blow your mind, but still listen up, okay? Visual targeting is the act of surveying the road in front of you and understanding objects or situations you may come across as you move forward (like highway signs, traffic signals and other cars.) There’s three visual targeting ranges you need to pay attention to:\r\n\r\n![visual targeting](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/visual-targeting.png)\r\n\r\n**Target Range**\r\n\r\nThe target range is about **21-30 seconds** ahead of you on the road and the best place to view what you’ll be encountering in the future. You should always be aware of anything happening in this range as you'll be approaching it quickly and may need to react.\r\n\r\n**Secondary Range**\r\n\r\nThe secondary range is about **11-20 seconds** ahead of you and where you’ll notice things like speed changes and lane changes. It’s still within **safe braking distance**, so you don’t have to worry about slamming on those puppies. Phew.\r\n\r\n**Immediate Range**\r\n\r\nThe immediate range is about **4-10 seconds** in front of you. This is within **safe following distance (3-5 seconds)**, but you still have less time to react to changes. You should be wholly aware of what you’ll be encountering in this range. The closer you get to the immediate range, the faster your reaction times will have to be.\r\n\r\nWhen driving, your strategy should be to use eye movements to survey all three visual targeting ranges repeatedly. This creates a complete image of what’s around and in front of you. If you can do that, then your[ defensive driving](https://www.aceable.com/defensive-driving/texas/) skills will be right on target!\r\n\r\nFor more visual strategies, take a peek at our article on [central and peripheral vision](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/vision-while-driving/) while driving.\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out the rest of our [safe driving videos](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/) for more tips to keep you in control on the road!"

That’s why it’s important to learn about **Hidden Operating Space**. Wait whaaa? Shhh. Calm yourself sweet child. We’ll explain. Driver safety is one of our top concerns in our driving courses, after all.\r\n\r\n**Space Management**\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nHidden Operating Space refers to the area around your car that’s impossible to see while you’re sitting in the driver’s seat. When you're taking your driving lessons, take a moment to recognize the spaces around your car that you don't have visual access to. Think of it as an invisible bubble engulfing your car. Like this:\r\n\r\n![No, the car is not floating in Jello. That’s the Hidden Operating Space.](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-18-at-2.02.22-PM.png) No, the car is not floating in Jello. That’s the Hidden Operating Space.\r\n\r\nHidden Operating Space can vary depending on the size of your car. A stretch limo has a biggggg operating space. A smart car has a teensy tiny operating space. Managing space around your car is crucial for defensive driving and for safe driving when you're behind the wheel.\r\n\r\nUntil we have super effective self driving cars, you'll have to be aware of this little space cushion around your car. It doesn't matter if you’re in an SUV or Prius, you need to monitor your Hidden Operating Space while the car is in motion as well as when it’s in park. Whether you're sitting still, backing up, turning left or right, changing lanes or simply driving forward, there's always a chance that something could be near your car's Hidden Operating Space. Here are some things that could be playing hide and seek in your vehicle’s operating space.\r\n\r\n1. Pets and other animals. Don’t hit Mittens! For the love of god don’t hit Mittens.\r\n\r\n2. Children. Please don’t hit the children. They lurk in the darkness, behind your parking spaces when you're out and about, in your nightmares. Nowhere is safe... Just kidding, kids are pretty cute. Which is why you need to be extra careful and keep an eye out for them.\r\n\r\n3. Bikes and toys. Less important, but running over a Super Soaker could do some serious damage to your car (and make your little brother cry).\r\n\r\nThat’s why it’s **crucial** to look around your car before you get in and start driving.

Let’s talk about what wide turns mean, and how to avoid truck accidents on the highway.\r\n\r\n **No Visibility**\r\n\r\nUnlike a left turn, when an 18-wheeler makes a tight right turn, their convex mirror is obstructed. Not good if you're in another vehicle. This is not as much of an issue when making a left turn, however, as the driver is on the left side and can look out their window.\r\n\r\n![Truckers need to be able to see well to turn right! ](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/8494892.jpg) Truckers need to be able to see well to turn right!\r\n\r\n**Off-Tracking of Trailer**\r\n\r\nDuring a right turn, a truck’s trailer (back part) does not follow the path of its tractor (front part). The trucker needs to correct for this by turner wider so that they don’t hit the curb, another vehicle or worse, a pedestrian. Truck accidents are bad news for everyone!\r\n\r\nHow Do Truckers Warn About Wide Right Turns?\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nBecause truckers need a lot of space to make wide turns, they must signal 100 ft before doing so. Additionally, all trucks must display a warning sign that lets you know about wide right turns. But you’re so informed now that you don’t even need that.\r\n\r\nMoral of the story: Be courteous to trucks, obey speed limits and be cautious of wide right turns (watch that left turn as well, while we're at it). Truck accidents can occur if a trucker doesn’t see you during wide turns, so you need to give them plenty of space to hang a right. Keep your eyes peeled when you see a truck turning at an intersection.\r\n\r\n Make sure to check out the rest of our [safe driving videos](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/) for more tips to keep you in control on the highway!"

When you’re driving, you’ve got all sorts of things you have to pay attention to other than the task of being a safe driver. Let’s talk about bicycles and other roadway users and break down just exactly how to share the roadway with them so everyone can navigate the highway transportation system and busy city roads safely to avoid crashes.\r\n\r\n **First off, let’s talk about what cyclists should do to share the roadway with cars.**\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nEven if you’re on a bike, you gotta follow the rules of the road; the traffic laws apply to you, too. Make sure you follow all road signs and traffic signals. Pay attention to right of way rules. Normal driving stuff. If you run traffic lights or signs, you’re putting yourself in a lot of danger.\r\n\r\nHere’s a list of bicycle safety rules you should follow if you’re on a bike:\r\n\r\n- Stop for stop signs and red lights\r\n- Follow all traffic signs and traffic laws\r\n- Go with the flow (of traffic)\r\n- Use turn lanes and arm turn signals so cars know where you’re going\r\n- Follow the posted speed limit, speedzilla\r\n- Don’t block traffic in a travel lane\r\n- Use lights when biking at night/in bad weather\r\n- Yield right of way to cars and other bike riders when you’re entering roadways\r\n- Don’t use your phone while biking\r\n- DO NOT bike while intoxicated\r\n- Aggressive driving is never cool, especially when there is a cyclist or bike lane near by\r\n- Watch out for [tractor trailers making wide right turns](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/trucks-make-wide-right-turns/)\r\n \r\n When presented with the opportunity, always ride in the bike lane. Sometimes things might be in the bike lane (even though they’re probably not supposed to be there) like large trucks delivering goods, cars temporarily parking, or maybe a pedestrian or two. When that happens, be careful, check around you for cars and other motor vehicles (the same way you would change lanes in a vehicle), and move into the general travel lane. BTW, you’re totally allowed to ride in the general travel lane at all times. You do you, boo. The best thing to do when you’re on the road is to stay close-ish to the curb to give yourself a good space bubble from motor vehicles. Just be aware of road conditions - be careful of debris or potholes and drivers opening parked car doors on the side of the road. One place a person riding a bike should avoid is the sidewalk. It’s dangerous for a few reasons - first off all, this is where all the pedestrians are, walking around, listening to headphones and super not expecting someone to breeze by them at 15 mph. Second of all, some sidewalks are hard enough for pedestrians to walk on, let alone bike. Unless you’re prepared for X-treme sidewalk biking, you’ll be safer on the street.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things you should wear as a bicyclist to be safe and seen when you're sharing the road with motor vehicles. In a car, you've got multiple safety features working together to protect you, so it's important to do the same when you're on a bike. Traffic safety and peace of mind are the rights and responsibilities of every wheeled warrior.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, make sure you have that bicycle helmet. Here’s a chart to show proper placement:\r\n\r\n<img style=\"max-width: 360px\" alt=\"Chart for proper helmet placement\" src=\"https://ace.imgix.net/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/helmet-placement.jpeg\" loading=\"lazy\" />\r\n\r\nIt’s also important that you have a reflector, a taillight and headlight, and a reflective vest/jacket. These things are important during the day, but SUPER important at night, for obvious reasons, but especially looking cool af.\r\n\r\n<img style=\"max-width: 360px\" alt=\"Wear a light up jacket and ride a light up bicycle for maximum safety\" src=\"https://ace.imgix.net/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/Lighted_bicycle_jacket.jpeg\" loading=\"lazy\" />\r\n\r\nDon't forget to wear your light up jacket! Bicycle safety is so 2016\r\n\r\n**Now let’s talk about what you need to do as a car sharing the road with a passing bicyclist.** \r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThese shared lane markings (or sharrows) are there to alert drivers that there are probably going to be cyclists on the road:\r\n\r\n<img style=\"max-width: 360px\" alt=\"Sharrows: Symbolism for Sharing the Road\" src=\"https://ace.imgix.net/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/sharrow.jpeg\" loading=\"lazy\" />\r\n\r\nSharrow the Road.\r\n\r\nYou’re gonna want to make sure you’re giving bikes plenty of space to avoid a collision - at *least* three feet. If the biker has to move quickly to avoid something in the road, you’ll be far enough away that it won’t be an issue.\r\n\r\nUnless you’re driving next to Lance Armstrong or something, most of the time you’ll be driving faster than the bike, so here are some tips when you want to pass a cyclist:\r\n\r\n- Keep at least three feet of space between you and the bike - more if possible\r\n- Pass on the left\r\n- Wait to pass until the traffic lane next to you is clear. This means: \r\n  - On a two-lane highway, wait until the opposing lane is clear\r\n  - On roads with more than two lanes, wait until the traffic lane on your left is clear before changing lanes\r\n- Be patient. You should only pass when it’s safe, even if this means driving behind a cyclist for a little while.\r\n- Always check your [blind spots](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/blind-spots/) for cyclists\r\n- As always, pay special attention at a crosswalk\r\n \r\nWhen you park, make sure you look in your mirror for cyclists before opening your door. Getting doored is a cyclist’s nightmare and it’s really hard to watch out for a car door when it shoots out randomly in front of you.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important areas to be aware of bicyclists is at intersections. Cyclists going straight or turning right will usually be on the right of a vehicle in an intersection, so it’s extra important to look for them if you’re turning right. Cyclists are also able to use the left turn lane at an intersection, so stay alert when the light changes.\r\n\r\nSharing the road is not limited to cyclists, however. Anyone with wheels is a certified roadway user - mopeds, people who are in-line skating, rollerskating, or skateboarding, tricyclists, etc. These rules apply to these vehicles as well.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, it’s all just about sharing the road. Remember, bicycles are people, too, and they have as much right to the road as cars. Stay patient and alert and you’ll be just fine. Sharing is caring, fam.\r\n\r\n Make sure to check out our [safe driving videos](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/) for more tips to keep you in control on the road!

It’s important for you to know about pedestrian safety so that we can change this staggering statistic for the better. Improving pedestrian safety is all of our responsibility. Pedestrian safety is especially important for teens, according to a [recent infographic](https://www.safekids.org/infographic/pedestrian-safety-and-teens) created by Safe Kids Worldwide.\n\nWalk a Fine Line\n----------------\n\nWhether you’re operating a motor vehicle or walking, you must follow pedestrian signals. For drivers, pedestrian crossing signs are just like any other traffic signal head. You must stop when you’re supposed to stop and wait to go until you’re supposed to go. For pedestrians, too, these signs aren’t simply a suggestion -- they’re the law! In fact, you can get a ticket for jaywalking, or crossing the street without following pedestrian signals or crosswalk markings. Think it’s no big deal to jaywalk? Getting into a pedestrian accident isn’t so far fetched. In 2012, 59,000 pedestrian crashes were injured across the United States. To put it into perspective, that’s nearly 10,000 more pedestrians crashed into than there are people living in the capital of Pennsylvania!\n\n![The Beatles know how to use a crosswalk.](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/giphy-9.gif) The Beatles know how to use a crosswalk.\n\nHave a Safe Trip\n----------------\n\nThere are many traffic safety elements in place to help pedestrians cross the road. Familiarize yourself with them so that you can help prevent pedestrian fatalities.\n\n- **Traffic Calming Devices** -- Physical designs in the road that help improve traffic safety for pedestrians, like a speed bump, pedestrian bridge or island in the middle of the street\n- **Detectable Warnings** -- Raised or grooved surfaces on curb ramps that tell the visually impaired when they are approaching a crosswalk or drop-off\n- **Uniform Traffic Control Devices** -- The U.S. Department of Transportation requires that pedestrian traffic signals across the country adhere to the same standards. Here are the signs that you should look out for and what they mean:\n\n![Pedestrian Push Button (DOT.gov)](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-09-at-6.00.41-PM-1.png) Pedestrian Push Button (DOT.gov)\n\n![Pedestrian Crossing (DOT.gov)](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-09-at-6.01.14-PM.png) Pedestrian Crossing (DOT.gov)\n\n![Yield to Pedestrians (DOT.gov)](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-09-at-6.00.58-PM-1.png) Yield to Pedestrians (DOT.gov)\n\n![Handicap Crossing (DOT.gov)](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Screen-Shot-2016-06-09-at-6.01.20-PM-1.png) Handicap Crossing (DOT.gov)\n\nNow that you know about pedestrian safety, looking out for people crossing the road near traffic heavy areas should be a cakewalk!\n\nImproving pedestrian safety is of the utmost importance.

You’re in a skid and you’re trying to stay in control.\r\n\r\nWhen you skid, your back tires lose traction with the road surface and try to move toward the front of your vehicle. The momentum can make the back of your car swing around in a fishtailing motion putting you and your car's safety in jeopardy. This is really similar to the experience you have when you hydroplane, only your front tires maintain some control. That’s enough to make anyone freak out, but it’s important that you stay calm and in control of the situation.\r\n\r\nEven though skids are more likely to happen in bad weather (rain, snow, slippery roads etc.), they can happen in all conditions. If you have anti skidding/ anti-lock brakes, or four-wheel drive, these features should help prevent skids and hydroplanes. Unfortunately though, these tools aren't always 100% effective. Luckily we're about to give you some driving safety tips for handling and reacting to car skids. You &gt; skid.\r\n\r\nThe first thing you want to do is take your foot off of the brake and accelerator pedals. As you do that, look in the direction you want to travel. This is really important. Have you ever looked at something as you were riding your bike and started accidentally steering in that direction? That’s exactly what will happen. So make sure you’re looking the direction you want to go.\r\n\r\nNext, you will slowly turn the wheel toward that direction. Be very careful not to oversteer or you will just keep skidding in the other direction. In these kinds of cases, it's better for your to understeer than oversteer. When you finally get under control and back on track, slowly straighten your wheel. Again, make sure you do not oversteer. At this point, you should be good to go and your tires should start to regain control.\r\n\r\nLet’s recap: 1. Stay calm. 2. Keep your foot of the pedals. 3. **Gently** steer in the direction you want to go- don't oversteer or jerk the wheel too quickly. Now you can be confident and ready to react if you begin to skid.\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out the rest of our [safe driving videos](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/) for more tips to keep you in control on the road!"

You’re ready for all of it! Let's chat for a minute about how to use different lane positionings to practice defensive driving. Whether you're in parent taught drivers ed, teen drivers ed or adult drivers ed, you'll need to know this information on the road.\r\n\r\n**Position 1:** The center of the lane. This is where you should be most of the time. Not too hot, not too cold; juuuust right with a little space cushion on both sides.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Lane Positions\" src=\"https://ace.imgix.net/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/position-1.png\" loading=\"lazy\" />\r\n\r\nPosition 1: Centered in your lane\r\n\r\n**Position 2:** The right side of the lane. This is a good place to go if someone is passing you. You’re still within the lines of the original lane and haven't changed lanes, you’re just shifted over to the right a bit to allow some extra space for the other driver to get by.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Lane Positions\" src=\"https://ace.imgix.net/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/position-2.png\" loading=\"lazy\" />\r\n\r\nPosition 2: Slightly toward the right side of your lane\r\n\r\n**Position 3:** The left side of the lane. Again, like position 2, you’re still within the lane lines. You would be in position 3 if there was someone pulled over on the shoulder, or perhaps someone riding a bicycle and you wanted to give them some space.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Lane Positions\" src=\"https://ace.imgix.net/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/position-3.png\" loading=\"lazy\" />\r\n\r\nPosition 3: Slightly to the left of your lane\r\n\r\n**Position 4:** Straddling the right side of the lane.

            "Body": "Do you know what a following interval is and how to determine it? If not, you’re in luck 'cause we're about to drop some following interval knowledge and driving tips.\r\n\r\nA following interval (or following distance) is the distance between you and the car in front of you. This defensive driving technique is useful for maintaining a safe following distance when you're driving behind other cars and for avoiding tailgating. People used to determine proper following distance using the number of car lengths between them as a reference. Now, the best way to make sure you're not following others too closely is to use the second rule.\r\n\r\nBasically all you do is count the seconds between when the car ahead of you passes something stationary (a road sign, a tree, the guy selling watermelons on the side of the road) and when *you* pass it. You want to try and hit that second following interval sweet spot of 3 - 5 seconds. If it takes you 3-5 seconds to pass an object after the car ahead of you has passed it, you're at a safe following distance. You’ll need more space the faster you’re driving, so keep that in mind. If you follow any closer than 3 seconds, you’ll be tailgating the person in front of you, like a big jerk.\r\n\r\nYou also want to increase your following interval to more than 3 seconds if the weather is bad. In bad weather (rain, snow, etc.), your tires lose traction with the road, so you need to give yourself more distance to stop. Increase the duration of time between passing objects to 5 or 6 seconds so you can feel more confident in your ability to hit the brakes in time. Don't forget, only jerks are tailgaters. Give the person in front of you plenty of space. Give yourself plenty of space. Space, man.\r\n\r\nOnce you pass your permit test and start traffic school, you can practice mastering perfect distance following in your driving lessons. Use your best judgement and remember the distance rules. If you're nervous you might not be able to stop abruptly without hitting the person in front of you- back. it. up.\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out the rest of our [safe driving videos](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/) for more tips to keep you in control on the road!"

            "Body": "Having good vision is absolutely necessary in order to drive a car. I know what you're thinking -- *le duh* -- but that’s why you're **required** to pass vision screenings at the DMV when you go [get a learner permit or driver license](https://www.aceable.com/) or even a CDL (commercial driver's license). If you can’t see road signs, signals and other cars, then you shouldn’t be driving. Let’s take a look-see at some of the important ways that your vision can assist you while driving.\r\n\r\n**Central Vision**\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nCentral vision is what you see out your front windshield when looking straight ahead. It’s where you’ll see lovely sights like highway litter, gas station signs and billboards like this one:\r\n\r\n![Central vision helps you see things like billboards while driving.](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/funny_billboards_1.jpg)\r\n\r\nYour central vision field is where the majority of visual information you receive while driving comes from. For example, central vision lets you know when cars in front of you have braked, when there’s a stoplight, when the speed limit decreases or when you should exit the interstate. All very important things.\r\n\r\n**Peripheral Vision**\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nPeripheral vision is a little less obvious, but it’s super important for driving. Basically, peripheral vision is what you see out of the corner of your eye when looking straight ahead. Peripheral vision lets you see when other cars are passing you, while still allowing you to focus on what’s in front of you. Do you see what I mean? (Note: Peripheral vision is not a substitute for [checking your blind spot](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/blind-spots/)!)\r\n\r\nPeripheral vision complements central vision to help you make informed driving decisions -- like when it’s safe to move over a lane, when there’s a pedestrian trying to cross or when you need to go to the car wash because a bird just pooped on your window (ugh, the worst). Peripheral visions lets you see potential hazards before they enter your central vision. Together, the two types of vision help make you a smarter driver. Pretty cool, right?\r\n\r\nAnd that’s what central and peripheral vision looks like!\r\n\r\nCorrective Eyewear\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nOlder drivers aren't the only ones who need to practice good vision care. As a new driver about to go through driving school, you're going to be required to take an eye exam and pass some vision requirements before you get your learner permit or driver license. If you don't have perfect eyes with 20/20 vision, you'll need to wear some eyeglasses or corrective lenses. Having visual acuity is so important when you're behind the wheel. If you can't see what's going on around you, you'll end up in some gnarly crashes. If you ever experience vision loss, low vision quality, or a vision condition that impairs your ability to driver safety, pull over immediately and call a ride. In most states, if you wear glasses or corrective lenses the driver licensing department will place a note on the back of your license ID noting this.\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out the rest of our [safe driving videos](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/) for more tips to keep you in control on the road!"

According to the NHTSA, aggressive drivers are those who drive too closely, drive at excessive speeds, weave through traffic and run stop lights and signs, among other crazy acts. No chill. This type of driving behavior can even get as bad as questionable and downright offensive gestures or yelling at another driver, actual confrontation, assault, and even murder in the most extreme cases.\r\n\r\nAggressive drivers aren’t just annoying to the cars around them, they’re also one of the biggest factors in highway collisions and can even lead to fatal crashes. Let’s take a look at some of the main behaviors of aggressive drivers, so that you know how to spot them on the road and can steer clear of aggressive driving yourself.\r\n\r\n**They're Definitely Not Defensive Drivers**\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"Be Aggressive, B-E Aggressive ... is not the motto.\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2016-05-12-at-12.21.02-PM.png\"]\r\n\r\nThink: improper lane changes, passing where it’s not allowed, changing speeds and lanes suddenly, not obeying traffic signs or not signaling. Basically, they partake in some seriously risky driving. Much like your mom’s liverwurst, aggressive drivers stink and should be avoided at all costs.\r\n\r\n**They Have Some Road Rage**\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"Agressive Drivers Are Impatient\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2016-05-12-at-12.21.25-PM.png\"]\r\n\r\nAggressive drivers might honk unnecessarily, flip you the bird or shout obscenities at another driver. These people clearly have no chill, and it’s best not to engage with them. Me thinks there needs to be an anger management class for people with road rage. Oh wait, there is -- and it’s called [Defensive Driving](https://www.aceable.com/defensive-driving/texas/) (ya know, like how you’re *supposed* to act on the road?!). Some people need to take this for real, y’all.\r\n\r\n**They Don't Understand Following Distance**\r\n--------------------------------------------\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"Aggressive Drivers Tailgate\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2016-05-12-at-12.21.47-PM.png\"]\r\n\r\nNo, not the kind of tailgating that involves cold brewskis, chili dogs and football jerseys. Aggressive drivers tailgate by following the car in front of them wayyyy too closely. These jerks don’t understand the meaning of personal space and could seriously use a [lesson on following distance](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/safe-following-distance/). They have zero concern for the driver's safety in cars around them. Get back, get back, you don't know me like that.\r\n\r\n**They Endanger Other Drivers**\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"Aggressive Drivers Prevent People From Passing\" src=\"/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2016-05-12-at-12.22.07-PM.png\"]\r\n\r\nTrying to safely pass the grandma in front of you? An aggressive driver might block your path or rapidly change speeds so that you can’t move over a lane. Just calmly wait until they’re done with their shenanigans before you try to pass.\r\n\r\nKnow anyone who displays these behaviors? Do *you* display these behaviors? Get you a [Defensive Driving course](https://www.aceable.com/defensive-driving/texas/) that’ll teach you how to avoid driving aggressively. Dangerous driving behavior can put pedestrians, people driving bicycles and motorcycles, other drivers and yourself at risk. Let’s keep traffic safety in mind out there, guys. The saying “better safe than sorry” never rang truer. The last thing you want is to cause an accident have to call your auto insurance company or the AAA foundation for a tow because you wrecked your car. Or even worse, hurt someone.\r\n\r\nIf you experience an aggressive driver on the road, pull over and let them pass. While you're pulled over, give a call to the state patrol or local police department so they can keep an eye out for this driver's vehicle on the road and prevent further incident.\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out the rest of our [safe driving videos](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/) for more tips on things like [distracted driving](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/distracted-impaired-driving/) and highway safety to keep you in control on the road!"

Check out this driving school video to learn about all the zones you need to know.\r\n\r\nOnce you receive your learner permit, you can practice being aware of your surroundings and keeping a safe following distance on the road. To use these defensive driving skills, you'll have to check your mirrors and look around you constantly. This goes for teenagers as well as adult drivers. Our top driving tips for having zone control are to:\r\n\r\n1. Remember that you exist not only in your car, but in the areas surrounding your car. You have to manage aaaaall that space as if you're responsible for knowing what other drivers are going to do within your zones. As a new teen driver, we know this sounds tough. And it is. But you'll get the hang of it with some practice.\r\n2. Keep a safe following distance from the cars around you. Remember learning about blind spots in driver education? Yeah, stay out of those too unless you want to end up in a bad situation. You should learn all about blind spots, following distance and zones before getting your driver license at the BMV or DMV (the name varies based on your state, weird huh?).\r\n3. When you're in a car driving, stay alert. You need to stay alert any time you're driving, not just when you're in traffic school and taking your road test. Being a safe driver is a lifelong skill, so be sure to stay aware of your surroundings any time you're in a car.\r\n\r\n!<img src=\"https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/vehicle-zones.png?auto=format,compress&amp;w=640&amp;h=640\" style=\"max-width: 1080px;width: 100%\" alt=\"vehicle zones\" />\r\n\r\nExpecting the unexpected can make you an expert at defensive driving and help you avoid an accident.

We know you're a smart Aceable driver who learned about all this during the driver licensing process, but we want to make sure all our Acelets are safe teen drivers.\r\n\r\nSpeeding is listed as the second highest cause of vehicle deaths after alcohol. According to NHTSA, or the National Highway Safety Administration, 9,262 people were fatally injured in accidents caused by motor vehicle speeding in 2014 alone. These weren't all in highway traffic either. Speeding can be dangerous anywhere. Y'all! There are speed limit signs posted everywhere for a reason. Do what they say (please)!\r\n\r\nNext up: distracted driving. 16% of traffic accidents by motorists are caused by distractions like texting, messing with the radio or a gps, or trying to unwrap that delicious crunch wrap supreme from Taco Bell. We know your mouth is watering- pull over. It's not hard to avoid these crash deaths. If there's something you need to do that simply can't wait (we know the Taco Bell is calling your name), stop the car on the side of the road. Simple as that.\r\n\r\nFatalities Broken Down by Role\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://ace.imgix.net/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/fatalities-broken-down.png?auto=format,compress\" alt=\"Car Accident Statistics\" style=\"max-width: 360px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\r\n\r\n70% of car accident victims are occupants inside the actual vehicle- the drivers and passengers. The other 30% are people outside of cars such as pedestrians and motorcyclists. You’re especially at risk if you’re the driver, but you also have the power to make this statistic smaller and avoid causing pain and suffering. Getting your driver license is a huge responsibility, and the safety of everyone on the street, sidewalk, and motorcycles is in your hands any time you're on the road. No pressure.\r\n\r\nTime When Fatal Crashes Happen\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://ace.imgix.net/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/time-fatal-crashes.png?auto=format,compress\" alt=\"Car Accident Statistics\" style=\"max-width: 360px\" loading=\"lazy\" />\r\n\r\nThis chart shows that Friday, Saturday, and Sunday are the riskiest days to drive/be on the road. Unsurprisingly, the weekends are the worst days for accidents. Be cautious on weekends - too much fun can kill you.\r\n\r\nGetting in a traffic accident can not only cause personal injury but can result in some hefty financial pains too. Crashes cost. Having to file a car accident claim with your driver insurance company can result in increased insurance costs. If you're in a motor vehicle accident, insurance companies think it's more likely to happen again, so the they charge more money to account for that risk. Not to mention if you end up getting a car accident injury, you could be paying off some medical bills too. Cha-ching. There goes all your hard earned cash.\r\n\r\nWe know reading all about safety facts and ways to prevent injuries and fatalities can be a bit of a downer, but it's super important to be informed! Luckily, organizations like NHTSA and IIHS (Insurance Institute for Highway Safety) are working hard to keep you in-the-know with analysis reporting.\r\n\r\nNow that you know the statistics and fatality facts, you can work towards being a better, safer driver. Being safe and aware on the road is the first step to reducing the number of car accident injuries each year and increasing traffic safety. You can do it, we believe in you!"

            "Body": "We’ve all heard the terms “driving stick” or “driving an automatic”, but do you know what these phrases actually mean when you’re behind the wheel? These types of driving actually refer to the kind of transmission your car has. Both types of transmissions require different steps to make the car run and behave how you want it to.\r\n\r\nIn this post, we’ll be covering the basics of automatic transmissions, and the info you’ll need to know to maintain and operate a car with this design.\r\n\r\n How to Maintain your Automatic Transmission\r\n-------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThere are few things you should keep an eye on to ensure your transmission has a long and healthy life:\r\n\r\n1. Go to a mechanic to flush out your transmission fluid every 2 years, or as needed. You can check your fluid level by pulling out the transmission dipstick found at the back of the engine and checking the color and level of the liquid. Both automatic and manual transmissions (or stick shifts) use transmission fluid to lubricate and cool internal parts. The difference is that automatic transmissions also depend on this fluid to transmit power hydraulically which exposes the fluid to a lot more heat than in a stick shift model. That’s why clean fluid is especially important in automatics. You can check out this [blog](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/automatic-transmission/) on signs your transmission fluid needs changed for more tips.\r\n2. Getting regular oil changes isn’t only important to the health of your transmission, but to every moving part of your car. It’s recommended that you change your oil every 3,000 miles. Having this done is fairly quick and inexpensive depending where you go, so be sure to stay on top of it.\r\n3. Keep an eye out for signs of damage to your transmission. The last thing you want if for a small problem to become a larger and probably very expensive problem. Signs that you might need a transmission repair are things like grinding noises when you switch gears, any leaked fluid left under your car when it’s been parked, or difficulty switching gears. Often times, a problem with your transmission can takes months to present itself, so keep an eye out for little signs so you can catch it early.\r\n4. If you’re not sure how often you should get transmission work done, take a look at your owner manual to find the recommended maintenance period for your specific model of car. The more you know, the better off you'll be!\r\n \r\nHow Do I Make it Move?\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nCars don’t just move in the direction you want by simply turning the steering wheel. In order to control your vehicle, you need to use an automatic gear shift, or the thingamajig next to the driver’s seat with a bunch of letters and numbers when you drive a car with an automatic transmission. That “thingamajig” is a gear shift lever, and those seemingly random letters and numbers represent gear ratios that can change the movement of your vehicle. These letters and numbers will be different than those you would find on a manual transmission, so let’s take a look at what those different gears on the automatic shifter mean.\r\n\r\nP is for Park\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nWhen you want to park your car, P is your friend. P locks the output shaft and keeps your car from rolling away. This is done with the help of a small internal part called a parking pawl that acts as a wedge in the output shaft holding it in place and stopping your car. When you’re parked on a flat surface, using only the park gear selection is totally fine. If you’re on a hill, however, make sure to use your parking brake as well. This decreases stress on the P gear and can actually increase the longevity of your automatic transmission. Don't forget to take off the parking brake next time you drive though, or you'll be driving with an unpleasant screeching sound.\r\n\r\nR is for Reverse\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nUse the R gear when you want to back dat car up. But before you move the gear shifter into reverse, make sure your foot is on the brake pedal. If you try to change gears from moving forward to moving backward without engaging the brake pedal, you run the risk of damaging your transmission or causing your car to accelerate suddenly and forcefully. You may not even have to worry about this, however, as many modern vehicles have a safety feature composed of solenoid valves that disable changing the gear selector into reverse when already moving forward. But like, still -- don’t do it.\r\n\r\nN is for Neutral\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe N position is your Switzerland, your neutral. You probably won’t shift into this gear very often -- it disconnects the automatic transmission from the drive wheels, and is mostly used for towing or pushing cars.\r\n\r\nD is for Drive\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nD is for drive, or what you’ll be doing 99 percent of the time you’re behind the wheel. Drive launches a full range of forward gear ratios, which change based on speed.\r\n\r\nL is for Low\r\n------------\r\n\r\nDrop it, drop it low when more power is needed at lower vehicle speeds. Low means the transmission is locked in first gear. The only scenarios in which you might use this gear is when driving in winter weather or for towing.\r\n\r\nIf you ever need an on-the-spot refresher about what means what with your automatic transmission gear shift, you should also be able to find all of this information in your owner manual (this should be kept in your glove box). Now that you know about automatic gear shift, are you ready to shift gears and learn about more [basic driving maneuvers](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/basic-driving-maneuvers/)?"

            "Body": "You’re driving along minding your own business when suddenly some aggressive jerk cuts you off without even signaling or checking his blind spot -- can you say road rage? Yikes. You’re muttering, “What an idiot!”\r\n\r\nYep, there are plenty of idiots out there. They speed up to beat red lights, they tailgate you, they flash their lights because they think you’re driving too slowly, they cut you off without so much as a turn signal to warn you, they honk their horns, and they regularly provide other drivers with the one-finger salute -- how rude. You're just trying to make your morning commute in peace!\r\n\r\nYour first response might be to whip out your phone and tweet angrily about it. You might even be tempted to speed up to teach that idiot driver a lesson. Please don’t! People have been run off the road, found themselves in car accidents and have even been shot by enraged motorists over such trivial circumstances... it’s not worth it! Not to mention a lot of these behaviors mean you're engaging in distracted driving, which is also super dangerous.\r\n\r\n According to Merriam-Webster, the definition of road rage is \"angry and aggressive behavior by a driver who is upset by how another person is driving.\" According to the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety, the majority of aggressive drivers are “young, poorly educated men between 16 and 26.” The AAA Foundation also notes that if these vehicle operators are suffering from IED (Intermittent Explosive Disorder) then these aggressive drivers could be anyone, regardless of income or education.\r\n\r\nWhile “aggressive driving” is just a traffic offense, “road rage” is a driver-blamed criminal offense. You don’t want to wind up doing serious jail time from vehicular homicide.\r\n\r\nHere are some tips for avoiding road rage and turning into an aggressive driving monster:\r\n\r\n- Most road ragers are usually dealing with some sort of emotional crisis, so if your girlfriend or boyfriend just broke up with you, be extra careful when you get behind the wheel. Give yourself some time to defuse before getting behind the wheel.\r\n- Expect other drivers to make mistakes and remember that everyone is human. You’ll be less freaked out when they do.\r\n- Be predictable. Always check your blind spots and use your signals when you change lanes so you don’t turn anyone else into a road rager. Checking all the views around your vehicle and being a considerate driver should help with preventing road rage.\r\n- If it’s rush hour or you find yourself in a traffic jam due to an accident, listen to music and just come to terms with the fact that you're going to run late. It's okay. No need to be inconsiderate to drivers around you by making obscene gestures at people trying to merge into your lane.\r\n\r\nFinally, here’s what the NHTSA (National Highway Transportation and Safety Agency) says you can do if you find yourself a victim of a road rage incident:\r\n\r\n- Avoid mad motorists, if at all possible. Ain't nobody got time for that negative energy.\r\n- Don't feed the trolls. If you try to speed up to pass an angry driver or prevent them from merging in your lane, it only makes things worse and can put your life in danger! Let them pass and leave plenty of room between you and that grump.\r\n- If an angry driver gives you the finger or makes another obscene gesture, be a grown up and ignore it. Such gestures have gotten people physically attacked many times. Um, no thanks.\r\n- Honk that horn only if you really have to for [defensive driving](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/defensive-driving-basics/) purposes... like if a driver is merging into your lane and doesn't appear to see you. Don't use your horn if you're simply annoyed because you're sitting in traffic. We're all in the same boat ... er, car. Honking your horn is meant to be used to alert other drivers, not to scold them. Take the high road, engage in polite driving.\r\n- Don't be afraid to report aggressive drivers to the authorities. You could save a life and prevent road rage from causing a bigger issue.\r\n- If you see a driver with road rage get into an auto accident, be cautious about approaching the vehicle and driver. Stop a safe distance away from them, then call the police to report the incident. Aggressive drivers can be unpredictable and it's important to keep yourself safe\r\n- If an aggressive driver starts following you, don't go home. Call the police and drive to the nearest police station. You don't want to become the victim of a road rage attack.\r\n \r\nIf you keep those tips from NHTSA and Aceable in mind, you'll help keep yourself and others safe on the road. This is definitely information you want to have locked away after you leave the DMV with your new license! A simple rule of thumb is to just be a courteous driver at all times. Now let's all be cool, okay?"

            "Body": "As a driver, it’s super important for you to know where the blind spots are on your own vehicle as well as other drivers' vehicles. Knowing this will help protect you and those around you from an easily-avoidable accident (no one wants to get sideswiped, really). Do you know where your blind spots are? Could you point them out on another car? Hint: just using your peripheral vision isn't good enough. You'll experience a large number of circumstances every time you drive where you'll need to know this information, so listen up and we'll teach you a thing or two about blind spot monitoring when driving and changing lanes.\r\n\r\nBlind spots are the areas to the sides of your car that can’t be seen in your rear mirror or side mirrors- to make sure these spots are clear before changing lanes, you'll have to physically turn around and look to see what kind of crazy stuff is going on out there. All it takes is a shoulder check and a mirror check to make sure you're safe to move over. A quick glance is simple enough, right? You don't have to be an advanced driver to master this skill.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-10-at-11.21.52-AM.png\" alt=\"Where are my blind spots\" style=\"width: 100%;max-width: 1080px\" /> \r\n\r\nAnytime you're changing lanes or merging, you'll want to check for any car blind spots in your driver view first. Flip on your turn signal to let other cars know you'll be moving over, and check your rear mirrors and side car mirrors. Finally, you'll want to do a quick shoulder check one last time. If you don't see any cars currently in these spaces, or any cars quickly approaching these areas around you, you're safe to flip on that turn signal and change lanes. Be sure to hold your steering wheel steady anytime you're doing one of these checks so you don't veer out of your lane accidentally while making sure the coast is clear. You'll also want to make sure you keep your rear windows clear from any obstructions in your visual field whenever you're driving so you don't create more blind spots for yourself. Keep anything you have loaded in the back of your car away from the windows if possible. If you're driving with passengers, you can always ask for driver assistance from them if they have a better view of your blind spots.\r\n\r\nIf you happen to have a car with a blind spot detection system and/or an audible alert system (these are sometimes called lane departure warning systems too), this can be a super helpful tool as well. This blind spot warning system should alert you any time your car is moving too close to another object. Even with this gadget, we still recommend doing a quick glance over the shoulder after checking the blind spot monitor just to be thorough. It's mind-blowing how quickly a car can come up beside you and be out of the driver visibility range, so doing a shoulder check is always your safest option.\r\n\r\nIf you’re coming up next to someone on a highway, don’t linger in another driver's side blind spots hidden from their visual field- especially if they have their turn signal on to switch lanes. ‘Cause if they can’t see ya, they’ll hitcha. Remember that not everyone on the road is an Aceable driver, so you can't always count on a turn signal to know if someone else is going to change lanes. Use your [defensive driving skills](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/defensive-driving-basics/) and trust no one. Keeping a comfortable distance and staying out of other drivers' blind spots is always the safest course of action.\r\n\r\nSo there you have it, the basics to making sure you have clear driver visibility while on the road. Keep in mind, an over the shoulder glance could save you from a serious accident and potential personal injury. Just checking your rear-view mirror and side-view mirrors or peripheral vision isn't always enough. Remember to drive safe, and drive smart!\r\n\r\nIf you want to learn more mastering blind spots take a look at our driver education courses: [Texas Drivers Ed](https://www.aceable.com/drivers-ed/texas-parent-taught/), [California Drivers Ed](https://www.aceable.com/drivers-ed/california/), [Florida Drug &amp; Alcohol Course](https://www.aceable.com/drivers-ed/florida/), [Georgia's Joshua Law Course](https://www.aceable.com/drivers-ed/georgia/), [Illinois Adult Drivers Ed](https://www.aceable.com/drivers-ed/illinois/), [Nevada Drivers Ed](https://www.aceable.com/drivers-ed/nevada/), [Oklahoma](https://www.aceable.com/drivers-ed/oklahoma/),[Ohio Drivers Ed](https://www.aceable.com/drivers-ed/ohio/), [Pennsylvania](https://www.aceable.com/drivers-ed/pennsylvania/), or one of our [Free Practice Tests](https://www.aceable.com/drivers-ed/) \r\n\r\nOtherwise, check out the rest of our [safe driving videos](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/) for more tips to keep you in control on the road!"

            "Body": "Parallel parking is more intimidating to most new drivers than your typical perpendicular parking (the kind you do in most parking lots). It involves steering in reverse, precise positioning, and quite a few obstructions you could accidentally scrape. You'll need to learn parallel parking if you plan on driving in the city, and there's a good chance you'll be tested on this skill at the DMV or DPS test center when you upgrade from your permit to your drivers license. Yeah, that's right. This will likely be on your driving test. But it’s going to be okay. Like most driving techniques, parallel parking just takes some practice. Once you understand the steps, it’s pretty easy to do without tapping a rear bumper or ending up embarrassingly far from the curb. And trust us, this is one parking skill you're going to want to have.\r\n\r\n## Step 1: Claim the Spot\r\n\r\nWhile you're driving, look for available parking spaces on the curb along the side of the street. The ideal parking spot will be at least one and a half times the length of your vehicle. Don’t try to squeeze into tiny spaces between other cars, especially if you’re a beginner and you don’t drive an equally tiny vehicle. Also, make sure you’re not too close to a fire hydrant, intersection, tow-away zone, etc.\r\n\r\nGot your eye on the perfect spot? Claim it! Turn on your turn signal ASAP so that any drivers, pedestrians, or bicyclists behind you understand that you’re about to park. Using your signal is an important step, especially when there's a lot of traffic on the roads. You don't want to confuse or endanger other drivers by stopping or reversing in a lane of travel without warning them. Drive past the empty space to pull up even with the vehicle in front of the space. You will be side by side with this other parked car.\r\n\r\n## Step 2: Back It Up\r\n\r\nCheck your rear-view mirror, your side-view mirrors, and over your left shoulder again. If you have a backup camera, check that too. Once you're sure there's no oncoming traffic to get in your way, change gears to reverse. You're ready to start maneuvering into the parallel parking space. Turn your steering wheel to the right while simultaneously backing up. (Most of your parallel parking conquests will be to the right, with left side parking being reserved for one-way streets.) This will guide the rear of your vehicle at a backward angle towards the parking space.\r\n\r\n## Step 3: Turn and Stop\r\n\r\nOnce your car is at a diagonal angle, turn your wheel to the left as you continue slowly backing up. Move backward slowly and carefully as you straighten the vehicle and get into the spot. Keep your foot over the brake pedal in case you need to stop quickly. Stop when you get close to the parked vehicle behind you. You don't want to tap bumpers, and you also don't want to park so close that getting out later will be hard. A little wiggle room is always nice.\r\n\r\n## Step 4: Straighten Up\r\n\r\nIf nothing has gone horribly wrong, you should be in the parking space at this point. You will be fairly close to the vehicle behind you and have several feet of clear space in front of you. Switch gears to “Drive”. You do NOT want to accidentally drive in reverse and hit the car behind you. Pull forward and turn your steering wheel to straighten out your wheels and get centered in the parking spot. Leave several inches of space in front of your car. Park and throw that parking brake into action! Your wheels should be 6-18 inches away from the curb. Closer is better since you don’t want to block the traffic lane or get sideswiped by a passing vehicle. A couple of feet is too far. We recommend trying out your parallel parking technique in a parking lot before taking on the real world. This will give you a low-pressure chance to really get down the moves.\r\n\r\nThat’s it! You parallel parked! If you continue to practice these steps, you'll be a parallel pro in no time! Check out more of our [safe driving videos](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/) to continue gaining pro status behind the wheel.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Parallel Parking\" src=\"https://ace.imgix.net/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/Screen-Shot-2016-12-09-at-10.13.26-AM.png\" loading=\"lazy\" />\r\n\r\nLeave 6-18 inches between your car and the curb\r\n\r\nHow Does Parallel Parking Work?\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nOkay! Time to delve into the science of parallel parking! We promise it's actually interesting stuff\r\n\r\nWhen you first pulled up to the front car and started to turn the wheel you used the “Ackermann Steering Linkage.” This mechanism was invented in 1817 and allows your tires to circle a common point by turning the wheels at slightly different points.\r\n\r\nAnother important mechanic that allows for parallel parking is the pivot point. As you turn your the point where the axis for your front tires and the axis for your rear tires meets gets closer and closer to your car. This point it called your pivot point and is what your car circles when you are turning.\r\n\r\nHopefully, that's not all too confusing. If you are a visual learner the video above explains the above comments in 360 degrees!"

Such is not the case for left turns. Oh left turns, why ya gotta be so rude? When at a green light sitting in the left turn lane, you must yield to oncoming traffic. That means two, three, five, 11 or 77 cars might go by before you can turn left. And you just gotta wait. \\*Grumble, grumble\\*\r\n\r\nI Saw The Sign\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nYou might see some signs on the road that politely remind you about right of way for left turns. They might look like this:\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Left Turn Yield on Green\" src=\"https://ace.imgix.net/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/Dallas_phasing_LT.jpeg\" loading=\"lazy\" />\r\n\r\nLeft turn yield on green\r\n\r\nYou might also see this sign:\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Left Turn Yield on Flashing Yellow (Sean Pollock/USAToday)\" src=\"https://ace.imgix.net/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/yellow-traffic-light-highway-safety-V4600FP-x-large.jpeg\" loading=\"lazy\" />\r\n\r\nLeft turn yield on flashing yellow arrow (Sean Pollock/USAToday)\r\n\r\nBest of all, you might be at an intersection with this sign.

That means you have to yield to the traffic moving to your right as well as the traffic moving to your left, to your left. Remember: The cars on the road with [more lanes always have the right of way.](https://www.aceable.com/blog/right-of-way-when-changing-lanes)\r\n\r\nAnd now you know that left will never be right (of way)."

But you know what they say … First is the worst; second is the best. (And third is the one with the hairy chest).\r\n\r\nT-Intersection\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nA T-Intersection is an intersection of two roads that looks like, well, a T. If you’re driving on the vertical line, or bottom part of the T, that means your road will end and you’ll have to cross onto the horizontal line, or top part of the T. Having trouble visualizing it? Here’s a picture. The motor vehicle with the \"A\" is approaching a cross street and must turn onto it.\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-26-at-4.41.12-PM.png\" alt=\"Today's blog post has been brought to you by the letter T.

(Shoutout to the GOAT, Sesame Street.)\r\n\r\nAlright, so now you know the basic right of way rules. But let’s revisit the initial question: Who has the right of way at a T-Intersection? Drumroll please ….\r\n\r\nThe Cross Street\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nThe cross street is the top part of the T. Cars on the cross street have the right of way. Motor vehicles on the street that runs perpendicular to the cross street do not have the right of way and must yield. Oftentimes when you approach a cross street, you’ll see a yield sign reminding you who has the right of way. Like this:\r\n\r\n<img src=\"https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/T-Intersection.jpgbc0bfe62-84f1-46bd-973c-adade8b5a3a8Larger.jpg\" alt=\"T for Turtle Crossing!

Flooding on roadways is serious business. If you don’t believe us, ask the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. They found that over half of flood-related drownings resulted from a vehicle driving into floodwater. Drivers who get stuck in floods aren’t crazy or really into risk-taking. Like most people, they just underestimate how dangerous a low-water crossing can be. Sometimes you can’t determine the depth of water if the road dips or if there aren’t any good reference points around. Even if it’s apparent that the water is only a few inches or a foot deep, drivers don’t realize how serious the consequences can be for driving through water. At the very least, it can result in some serious vehicle damage, and at the worst can result in you or one of your passengers drowning.\n\n **The Power of Floodwater**\n---------------------------\n\n6 inches: Six inches of water is enough to cause a vehicle’s tires to lose traction and slide. Sure, you probably not at risk of drowning, but you could easily lose control of your car and get into a serious crash.\n\n12 inches: It only takes a foot of water to float most cars. If you’re floating, you’re not steering or braking. Rushing floodwater can carry you downstream.\n\n2 feet: Floods are risky for even the largest, toughest vehicles. A pickup truck or SUV can be carried away by only a couple feet of water.\n\n\\>2 feet: At this point, your car can definitely get carried away if you try to drive through a flooded area. An additional danger with driving through flooded roads at this point is the possibility of your engine hydrolocking and losing function of your electronic components. Hydrolock happens when floor water makes it into the combustion chamber and prevents the engine from running. If your vehicle stalls, turning around is no longer an option without a working engine. Ditch your car and get to safety immediately. Insurance can help with any damages to your car, but it can't save your life.\n\n![Never drive on a flooded street](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/200-1-1.gif) If your dog is catching fish in the street, you probably shouldn’t drive there.\n\n**Turn Around, Don’t Drown**\n----------------------------\n\nThe best thing you can do to protect yourself and your car when there’s a flood is to follow this advice: Turn Around, Don’t Drown (TADD). If you come upon a roadway that appears to be flooded, DON’T try to drive through it. If you come across barricades blocking off a flooded section of the road, DON'T try to drive around them. Turn around and find a detour. It’s closed for a reason. Don’t destroy your car or risk your life due to impatience. Avoid flooded areas, and learn [how to avoid hydroplaning](https://www.aceable.com/blog/what-is-hydroplaning/) when you're driving on wet roads with standing water. Flood safety everyone! It's no joke.\n\nBefore heading out for a drive, make sure to check the weather for the possibility of any flash floods, heavy rain, hurricanes, highway and road flooding or storms. If you see any warning for these conditions, be sure to do some investigation to find out what routes you can take to avoid driving through floods and dangerous areas.\n\n![Even a foot of floodwater can carry a car away](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/giphy-1-15.gif) Don't be naive about the dangers of flood driving."

Fun. Slipping and sliding all over the road when you're driving your car in rainy weather? Terrifying. If you've ever hydroplaned, we're sure you'd agree that it's not a fun time.\r\n\r\nLet’s take a look at what’s happening when a vehicle is skidding and hydroplaning (also called aquaplaning) on wet roadways and how you can prevent hydroplaning from happening to you.\r\n\r\n  **Explaining Hydroplaning**\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen a car hydroplanes, the vehicle tires experience a loss of traction with the road and skid over the surface of the water. While most vehicles are equipped with traction control and anti-lock brakes to help keep your car from veering off the road and help you regain traction if hydroplaning occurs, it's still a scary situation that you should try to avoid. That's why it's best to keep clear if water depth builds up on the road surface causing puddles.\r\n\r\nWhile it might seem like common sense to avoid driving through heavy rain or deep puddles of standing water caused by poor drainage, even small amounts of wet pavement on the street can cause a vehicle's tires to skid and the vehicle to hydroplane. This type of traction loss can temporarily keep you from steering or braking.\r\n\r\nPrevent hydroplaning by reducing your speed if it’s raining or has recently rained. It doesn't have to be pouring outside for hydroplaning to happen. Vehicle speed and road surface conditions are the major factors in hydroplaning. Make sure all your vehicle movements (including braking and accelerating) are gradual and careful in wet weather. We also recommend avoiding cruise control when the roads are wet -- it can make a hydroplane a lot more dangerous. This is the best way to avoid skidding whether the roads are wet or not.\r\n\r\n**If It Happens to You**\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you feel a loss of control and your vehicle starts to hydroplane, try not to panic. Keep your hands on the wheel and steer into the direction of the skid while applying gradual pressure to your brakes until your vehicle slows enough for you to regain control. Slamming on the brake pedal will only make the skidding worse and could result in the loss of directional control. Again, do NOT rely on quick braking if hydroplaning happens. Your wheels won't stop they'll just slide. Avoid jerking the wheel dramatically in the opposite direction. Just keep steering and try to brake gently. Soon, you will feel your vehicle regain traction and stop sliding.\r\n\r\n**Don’t Tread Lightly**\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nWhile hydroplaning is always a possibility on wet roads, you can lower your chances by making sure your tires have good tread. Tread is made up of the rubber parts of the tire that actually make contact with the pavement. The tread design and the hollow grooves in tires work together to channel water away from the tire to reduce and avoid hydroplaning. As your tires get older, the rubber wears down and the tire tread depth gets more shallow. This can cause the tires to become less effective at preventing skids. You should [measure your tire tread](https://www.aceable.com/car-maintenance/how-to-measure-tire-tread/) once in a while and replace old tires when necessary. It's also helpful to keep the right level of air pressure and to check the tire pressure in your tires regularly.\r\n\r\nKnowing how to control emergency situations like hydroplaning is one of the most important aspects of [defensive driving](https://www.aceable.com/defensive-driving/). The general rule of thumb is to slow down when you're driving on wet surfaces, you're at the highest risk of hydroplaning when you're accelerating. So there you have it, some hydroplaning basics for driving in wet conditions. Be safe out there!\r\n\r\nMake sure to check out the rest of our [safe driving videos](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/) for more defensive driving tips to keep you in control on the road!

Or maybe it’s not the desert, but it’s summer and it’s really, really hot. Do you know how to keep yourself, your passengers, and other drivers safe? We’ll help you out.\n\n[](http://giphy.com/gifs/road-fury-wagon-bBxtmznaKxiog)We'll cover a few car care tips you'll want to know before driving in hot weather. Everything from keeping your air conditioning going strong to what can happen if you let your tire pressure increase or decrease too much. You might not always cover this information in drivers ed or when you learn about defensive driving tactics, but it's super important so pay attention!\n\n  Overheating \n------------\n\nWhat should you do if you see this symbol on your dashboard? Of if the gauge on your temperature gauge is all the way over to H? Pro tip: it should always be somewhere between C and H when your car is running.\n\n![Heat Symbol Dashboard](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/19575.jpg)\n\nImmediately pull over and let your engine cool. That symbol is part of your temperature gauge and means that your car is getting too hot and is in danger of overheating. This can cause your vehicle's engine permanent damage within minutes. You’re more likely to see this symbol in the summer, so be on the lookout.\n\nIf you absolutely can't pull over right away, turn off your air conditioner and turn on your car's heater, full blast. Really! Your heater works by pulling hot air from your engine which can cool your engine down. Note: this will definitely not cool you down, but it could save some pricey repairs on your car!\n\nIf you find that your car is overheating when the weather is mild, you're probably looking at a different problem like low coolant levels. This can also be caused by a leak in your cooling system in one of the many parts that make it up, like the radiator, tubes, or water pump.\n\nTire Blowouts\n-------------\n\nAnother important tip is to make sure your tire pressure is at the right level whenever you're driving in extreme heat. Low tire pressure in combination with hot temperatures can be the perfect recipe for a tire blowout. This is the last thing you want to happen in the middle of a sweet road trip, or ever really. Just another reason why staying on top of your car maintenance is so important.\n\n![how to care for your tires in the summer](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/tire-car-in-the-summer-1024x683.jpg)\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nKids and Animals\n----------------\n\nYou should never leave kids or animals in a car, period. But you **especially** shouldn't be doing this when it's hot outside. Even on a mild day (70 degrees or so), the temperature inside a car can reach up to 120 degrees in no time at all -- even with windows cracked! Keep this fact in mind before bringing animals or little ones on your summer driving outings. The dangers of leaving living beings in a car are literally fatal and leaving a window down isn't always enough to keep kids and animals cooled down.\n\nWith these tips, this summer you can be cool and stay cool no matter what weather you're driving in.\n\n![Dang, Joe.](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/giphy-4-5.gif) Dang, Joe."

Have an Emergency Kit**\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nYour vehicle has a trunk, right? Dedicate a little space for a safe winter emergency kit just in case you get stranded in terrible weather. It should include a cell phone charger, blankets or warm clothing, a basic first-aid kit (plus any specific medications you or your family members might need), a shovel, an ice scraper for snow removal, and drinking water. Monopoly and Cheez-its are optional. It's also a good idea to have the contact info for a service like AAA in case you need assistance getting your car unstuck or need a tow. We recommend having some kind of roadside assistance service like AAA for emergency situations.\r\n\r\n**3. Keep Up with Maintenance**\r\n-------------------------------\r\n\r\nThere is never a convenient time for your car to break down, but you REALLY don’t want to be stuck on the side of the road during a snow storm. That’s why it’s important to take the extra time to make sure your preventive maintenance is up to date before winter hits. Make sure your brakes are working perfectly (bad brakes don't stand a chance on icy roads) and [check the tread ](https://www.aceable.com/car-maintenance/how-to-measure-tire-tread/)and air pressure in your tires (Did you know that a tire gets lower air pressure when the temperature outside dips?). You'll also want to make sure your [coolant](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjP2sjp65zTAhVS-2MKHV9YD8cQFggiMAA&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.aceable.com%2Fsafe-driving-videos%2Fcheck-and-change-engine-coolant%2F&amp;usg=AFQjCNFjBA0HmNlMeIAGpmS-L7etuz5ydQ&amp;bvm=bv.152180690,d.amc&amp;cad=rja), [oil](https://www.aceable.com/car-maintenance/check-engine-oil/), and gas levels are good to go and that your windshield defroster is working properly. And for the love of Ace, handle that check engine light that’s been staring you down! Also, make sure your windshield wipers are working properly to keep your windshield visibility nice and clear on the road. Fresh new wipers will effectively clear snow and ice from your windshield no matter how heavy it's coming down.\r\n\r\nIf you live in a particularly cold area of the country that experiences a ton snowy road conditions, you might want to also consider winterizing your vehicle. Some tips are putting snow chains on your tires to increase traction or investing in snow tires, replacing your wipers with winter wipers, and adding sandbags to your trunk. The added weight over the rear tires will increase traction when cornering (and accelerating, if your car is rear-wheel-drive). If you're going to use snow chains, make sure they meet any chain requirements set by your individual state.\r\n\r\n**2. Go Slow**\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nThe biggest threat to drivers on wet, icy, and snowy roads is the loss of traction. If you're driving on a road covered with ice and snow at the same speed and carelessness that most drivers have on a sunny day, you’re going to skid. Luckily antilock brakes can help with skids, but you still need to be careful. Even if snowplows have come through and cleared the road for travelers, there might still be slick spots hiding on the road. Just slow down and keep your hands on the wheel at all times. Accelerate and apply brakes gradually to avoid losing traction and causing your tires to slide across lanes. Also, do one maneuver at a time. It’s more important than ever to reduce your speed THEN turn your steering wheel instead of braking while turning. Drive like a grandma. It’s fine. Roadway safety is so important.\r\n\r\nJust like any other time you're on the road, you'll want to make sure you're avoiding participating in distracted driving habits. Safe teen drivers don't play like that and being a focused driver is crucial to vehicle safety and driving survival. Especially in bad weather conditions.\r\n\r\n**1. Stay home if Possible**\r\n----------------------------\r\n\r\nAnd the number one way to stay safe during winter weather? Don’t drive at all! Seriously. Avoid the roads and leave your vehicle in the driveway to collect snow. If you don’t absolutely need to get somewhere, go ahead and make some hot chocolate and chill on the couch.\r\n\r\nIf you do have to drive on an icy road or you're out in inclement weather conditions, just remember to follow these tips, winter driving is no joke. Take it slow, practice gradual braking, and stay safe out there!"

According to AAA Exchange, driving in wet weather contributes to more than 1.2 million accidents per year. Can you believe that? Hopefully, we'll have super safe self-driving cars that don't need to worry about wet roads in the future, but in the meantime, here are some driving tips. Just in case Weezy makes it rain after you pass your driving test at the DMV.\n\n **More Tips For Driving In Hazardous Conditions** Select a Topic Tips for Driving in Rain and Wet Weather Tips for Driving in Snow and Winter Weather Tips for Driving in Hot Weather What to Do if You Start Hydroplaning The Dangers of Driving In Floodwater Your goal when driving in wet weather and hazardous conditions is to see and be seen clearly and to maneuver and brake your vehicle safely. All of these tasks are very important when you're on the roadway. Let's break it down with some fresh driving guidelines for wet weather driving.\n\nVisibility \n-----------\n\nFirst thing's first. Make sure your windshield wipers are working properly, are clean, and don’t leave streaks. If they are leaving streaks, take a rag and wipe them off. If your wipers aren't working well after cleaning them off and you're struggling to see out of your windows in the rain, you may want to consider replacing them.\n\n![Yep, looks good.](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/giphy-1-11.gif) Yep, looks good.\n\nNext, check your headlights, brakes, and turn signals to make sure they’re working. It’s SUPER important that you turn your headlights on any time the windshield wipers are on. In many states, it's the law. This can help increase driver safety when you're in the rain and ensure you still see roadway hazards like deer, bumpy railroad tracks, people, and other cars. You may be able to see everyone else, but you also have to make sure that they can see you. Headlights are a great way to increase your visibility to other drivers.\n\nTraction and Braking \n---------------------\n\nNext, it's time to check your tire tread. If you stick an upside-down penny into the tread of your tires, the tire should come just past the top of Abe Lincoln's head. If the tread doesn't reach this point, it's time to get new tires. You also want to make sure the tire pressure is at the recommended PSI for your tire model, so check them monthly.\n\nIn wet weather, you'll want to drive slower than normal. You also want to avoid sharp turns, braking too hard, and accelerating too quickly. All of these abrupt actions can cause [skidding](https://www.aceable.com/blog/steering-out-of-a-skid-its-scary-but-you-can-stay-in-control/) or hydroplaning, so be careful. If you do skid or hydroplane, the key is to not overcorrect. Simply ride out the skid and try to steer your car away from traffic to the outside of the roadway in a **gradual** motion.\n\nYou should also consider increasing your following distance and decreasing your speed, especially when it's raining during expressway driving. Make sure you’re only completing one action at a time. Braking, turning, and accelerating should all be separate actions -- brake, then turn, then accelerate. Give yourself and others around you extra time to complete each action throughout the duration of the hazardous driving conditions.\n\nSo there ya have it, some guideline tips on wet weather driving so you can stay Aceable on the road."

Did you know that you’re 30 times more likely to be ejected from a motor vehicle during a [crash](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/car-accident-statistics/) if you’re not wearing a seat belt? Yeah, *ejected*. That’s a word that should only apply to missiles and DVDs, not people. Crashing through a windshield and onto the street, or worse into highway traffic) makes surviving a crash unlikely, so it’s in everyone’s best interest to buckle up before every drive and practice some seat belt safety, whether you're the driver or a passenger. Seat belt laws aren't in place just for fun. According to AAA Exchange, nearly 33,000 people are killed in crashes and accidents each year. This is scary, we know! But wearing your seat belt can help reduce this number. See what good old Isaac Newton has to say about the physics involved.\r\n\r\n Isaac Newton’s First Law of Motion\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\nAccording to this law of physics, also known as the Law of Inertia, “An object at rest will remain at rest, and an object in motion will remain in motion (at a constant velocity) unless acted upon by an external force.” Sounds simple enough. Things don’t just start or stop moving on their own. They’re gonna keep doing their thing until something (a force) changes that. In the case of a vehicle, its movement is usually stopped by the friction of brakes.\r\n\r\nWear Your Seat Belt \r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nWhy are we bringing up the First Law of Motion in order to convince you to wear a seat belt? Because the Law of Inertia applies to you whenever you’re in a vehicle (also all the time, but that’s beside the point…). Your body is traveling at the same speed as the vehicle even though you’re just sitting on your butt. If the vehicle stops abruptly, whether it’s a hard stop or an automobile accident, your body will continue moving forward. Something’s gotta stop that motion and airbags usually aren't enough. Do you want it to be a seat belt or the windshield? Seat belts prevent excessive injury when your vehicle and your body need to slow down in a hurry. This applies whether you're in the driver seat, passenger seat or if you're a back seat passenger.\r\n\r\nSeat Belt Safety for Kids \r\n--------------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you're driving with a child passenger, there may be a few other factors you have to take into consideration to make sure they're securely belted into their seats. As a starter point, kids under 13 should always ride in the back seat. Even with proper child restraints, kids are just too small to ride safely in the front seat. This is mostly because airbags aren't meant for child passenger safety.\r\n\r\n- **Car seats**: Up until age 2 kids should ride in a car seat facing the rear of the car. From age 2 to around 5 years old you can turn the car seat towards the front of the car facing the child forward.\r\n- **Booster seats**: Once they hit around age 5, child passengers should use a belt-positioning booster seat. They should continue using a booster seat until a seat belt fits them properly.\r\n- **Seatbelts**: The recommended height for using a seat belt without any additional devices is 57 inches. The lap belt should lie flat on the child passenger's lap (not their stomach) and the shoulder belt should cross at their shoulder (not their neck). This means the child is also tall enough that the air bag will work as intended.\r\n \r\nPutting on your seat belt may seem like a simple and sometimes pointless task, but we assure you that you'll feel differently if you're ever in a car accident. Choosing not to buckle up can result in some really serious injuries or even a fatal injury. Not to mention, there are seat belt laws in place that could result in you having a chat with a law enforcement officer.\r\n\r\n<img alt=\"Be cool like this guy, wear a seat belt.\" src=\"https://ace.imgix.net/uploads/sites/4/2021/04/seat-belt-safety.png\" loading=\"lazy\" />\r\n\r\nBe cool like this guy, wear a seat belt.\r\n\r\nThe good news is that the number of drivers and occupants getting buckled up before hitting the road is rising! According to the National Highway Safety Administration, seat belt use reached a historic 90.1% in 2016. This could be the result of more traffic safety features in cars, more effective drivers ed courses (cough, cough, Aceable) or perhaps a better awareness of defensive driving techniques and how to increase passenger safety nationwide. Whether you're a teen or adult driver, have a seat belt policy in your car that you don't start driving until all of your passengers are have fastened up. Be smart. Wear a seat belt."

You could save up to 8 lives by signing up to be an organ donor! Some individuals and groups have religious or personal reasons for not wanting to participate in organ and tissue donation, and that’s totally fine. But if you’re among the 55% of Americans who haven't signed up for the donor registry yet, maybe some of the following donation facts will help you make the choice register.\n\nOrgan Donation Statistics\n-------------------------\n\nEvery 10 minutes, someone is added to the national transplant wait list. That's thousands of people waiting for an organ matching their needs or a matching tissue donation. Many people have found themselves in critical need of a new organ, including some names you might recognize like Tracy Morgan, Steve Jobs, and former Vice President Dick Cheney. They were lucky to receive life-saving transplants from organ donors in time. On average, 22 people on that wait list die each day while waiting for an available organ to be transplanted. That's why it's so important to understand organ donation and how it can save lives.\n\n![Celebrities and organ donation](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Screen-Shot-2016-12-09-at-10.59.48-AM.png) Tracy Morgan, Steve Jobs, and Dick Cheney have all had organ transplants\n\n![registering for organ donation](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/giphy-13.gif) When you find out about the organ donor registry\n\nHow You Can Help\n----------------\n\nPractically anyone can sign up to be an organ donor, even infants and senior citizens! There is always a demand for kidneys, livers, hearts, and other vital organs. If you've made the donation decision, simply enroll in your state’s registry when you’re applying for (or renewing) your driver’s license. You can also [sign up online](http://www.organdonor.gov/becomingdonor/stateregistries.html) if you're not in the process of updating your driver license or if you don't have one yet. If you’re under 18, discuss this choice with your family.

Rest assured that if you get sick or injured, doctors will do absolutely everything possible to try to save you before collecting your organs. If you're in an accident, paramedics won't look at your driver license to check for an organ donation indicator until you've passed away. So you don't worry that you won't be treated with the best care just so your body to be used for organ or tissue donation. Saving your life will always be the #1 priority before an organ transplantation.\n\nAn organ donation could potentially save the life of up to 8 transplant recipients. The donor's family won’t have to pay any fees associated with the organ transplant or the donation process, and your body will not be disfigured if your family wants to have a funeral ceremony. We know it all sounds a little scary, but it's part of life, and you could save the life of someone else. If organ donation sounds like the right choice for you, register to join the 125 million+ other donors nationally. If you'd like more information on the topic, check out some of the donor organizations like [Donate Life](https://www.donatelife.net/). You can also request additional information from the DMV. Thank you for the selfless commitment to saving the lives of people in need.\n\n![organ donations don't cost the family anything ](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/giphy-1-6.gif) When someone says they’re scared of donating organs"

Like most states, Texas requires all drivers to carry a car insurance policy. The point is to make sure you’ll be financially responsible for any damage you cause in a collision. How would feel if someone who was uninsured or underinsured crashed into you, totaling your car, and then said, “Sorry dude. I’d help pay for that, but I’m broke so it’s on you.” The DMV requiring that all motorists have car insurance protects everyone from situations like that. Being an uninsured motorist is also illegal, so take your pick of the numerous auto insurers and insurance coverage plans on the market.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nCompare Rates in Minutes\r\n\r\n#### Shop For Car Insurance\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAre you spending too much on car insurance?

There’s a minimum amount of coverage you have to buy, but anything more is up to you. Texans need at least a “30/60/25” plan that pays for crashes they may cause. It’s also known as liability insurance. Here’s what those liability limits cover:\r\n\r\n30,000 - bodily damage per person in a crash\r\n\r\n$60,000 - maximum amount your policy will cover for the collision\r\n\r\n$25,000 - maximum amount of property damage that will be covered\r\n\r\nLiability coverage pays out the minimum amount required by the state in the event of an accident or collision. Any costs outside of what your insurance company covers could be left to the driver to cover.\r\n\r\nOther Types of Auto Insurance\r\n-----------------------------\r\n\r\nIf you can afford a more robust insurance policy, it might be a good idea for you. Most car insurance companies offer the following types of coverage:\r\n\r\n**Personal Injury Protection** - PIP coverage, also known as “no-fault insurance,” is nice to have if you find yourself with a bodily injury from a crash. It doesn’t matter if the collision was your fault or someone else’s. Personal Injury Protection means your insurer will cover medical expenses (possibly including lost wages and funeral costs) for you and your passengers if you file a complaint. One drawback: having PIP may limit your ability to sue someone for damages related to a crash.\r\n\r\n**GAP coverage** - Look at the cars around you. There’s a good chance that many of them are not paid off by their owners. Most people get auto loans from banks to buy cars, then pay for them slowly over a few years. But what happens if you experience a crash before the vehicle is paid off? You don’t want to be stuck with the same payments on a car that’s been crushed like a tin can. GAP (Guaranteed Auto Protection) coverage pays for the difference between the vehicle’s actual value and the amount you owe on the loan, which could be a substantial amount. GAP coverage could be a good choice for anyone buying a brand new car and/or putting down a small down payment.\r\n\r\n**Comprehensive and Collision Coverage**- Most multi-vehicle collisions result in some damage to both vehicles. [If you cause a crash](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/what-to-do-after-a-car-accident/), your required liability insurance will cover costs for the driver you hit. If your car is damaged too, you could be out of luck unless you have comprehensive collision insurance. This type of coverage will pay for damages to your own vehicle if you crash into another car or an object. Comprehensive insurance may also help you out with damages caused by other unfortunate events (vandalism, theft, fire, natural disasters, etc.).\r\n\r\nUm, is this covered by my auto insurance company? Motorist coverage may sound confusing what with all the talk of premiums and damage coverages and different kinds of plans, but it's really not as tricky as you think! A lot of the major insurers have a step-by-step process that explains exactly what the benefits of each payment coverage plan. Do some research, have a conversation with your parents or an insurance broker, and get driving!"

You can opt for direct lending where you take out a loan from your bank or credit union, you can go with dealer financing which involves financing to vehicle directly with the car dealership, or you can go through a finance company that specializes in the topic. How car financing works is the bank loans you a certain amount of money. You agree to pay that money back in monthly payments over a set amount of time until you pay back the full purchase price (the set amount of time is a maximum, meaning you can pay off the car loan before this set time reaches its full life if you want to).\n\n![car financing interest rates](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Screen-Shot-2016-05-10-at-10.50.26-AM.png)\n\nSounds great, right? Well, there’s a catch. Every month you’ll have to pay a certain amount of interest, which is a set percentage rate of the loan. You might get offered different finance rates and financing options based on your consumer credit score and credit history. For example, if you have bad credit you might get a less appealing month-to-month loan than you might receive if your credit score is stellar.\n\nThe chart above shows what you could be paying in interest for a vehicle loan. This means that all the money you’re paying is not going toward paying off the actual auto loan, but to paying the bank as well. For example, on a 60-month $5,000 loan with 10% interest, you would pay $1,374.11 more than the original purchase price to the bank.\n\nFor this reason, it's probably a better option for you to save up and pay cash for a car if you can. Doing this lets you avoid paying those pesky interest fees and you'll pay less overall. If you can't afford to save up and pay outright, vehicle financing a car may be a better option for you. Financing can help you build up your credit, but will also cost you more in the long run. Choose wisely and keep in mind the pros and cons of each option."

Either way, you’re going to be dropping a lot of money for something that will ideally last you for years and years. It’s important to pick the ride that’s right for your budget whether that budget is 10 thousand dollars or 20 thousand dollars. So what’s the better deal when you're buying cars: new vs. used?\r\n\r\n## New Cars\r\n\r\nLet’s start with the really fun option. Getting a brand new car would be amazing. That shiny, perfect paint, that pristine upholstery, the intoxicating plastic-y whiffs of “new car smell.” Without a doubt, buying a new vehicle is a wonderful luxury for those who can afford it. True, the price tag at the dealer is going to be higher than a used car’s, but you’re paying for peace of mind and reliability. New cars usually come with warranties (ask the dealership about what the warranty covers and how long the warranty lasts) and probably won’t need any serious maintenance or major repairs for a while.\r\n\r\nThere are a few things to keep in mind with a new car. First is that the cost of insurance is higher for a new vehicle than it is for an older one. Next, make sure you understand your total cost if you're financing a vehicle or taking out a car loan because that's totally different than buying outright. And lastly, be aware that the value of a new car depreciates over 10% the minute you drive it off the lot. So if you're hoping to sell the car later, the resale value will be a lot less than what you paid for it when it was a brand new car. Most cars don't really hold their value, so don't necessarily think of a new car as investing in something that will garner a high return down the road.\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"New cars cost more, but require less maintenance\" src=\"/uploads/2016/05/200-1-2.gif\" width=\"500\"]\r\n\r\nWhen you're ready to throw down for a new car\r\n\r\n## Used Cars\r\nOkay, so you never hear TV game show hosts yelling in excitement about someone’s chance to “WIN A USED CAR!!!” But that doesn’t mean you should rule out a pre-loved set of wheels. They’re usually way more affordable than new cars. What's your poison? Hondas? Mercedes? BMWs? Jeeps? You can find any of these brands used. There’s also a huge range of price points to choose from, whether you’re cool with a decade-old vehicle that gets the job done or a barely used car with a small number on the odometer. Whether you’re looking for something no-frills or top of the line, it’s always going to be cheaper if you get it pre-owned. Sure, you might not get that new car smell when you're buying used, but that's what air fresheners are for, right?\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"Save money by buying a used ca\" src=\"/uploads/2016/05/200-2-1.gi\" width=\"500\"]\r\n\r\nWhen you’re trying to save some money by buying used\r\n\r\nJust remember to inspect used cars carefully before making your purchase. Even if the car has no obvious, serious flaws, it’s a good idea to request a vehicle history report. The report (connected to the VIN, or Vehicle Identification Number) will include information about past issues such as crashes the car was involved in, flood damage, etc. This can also alert you to any repairs that might need to be made on the used car so you can account for that in your end cost. Do your research, then enjoy your new(ish) car!\r\n\r\n[image alt=\"Research used cars to make sure they are not lemons\" src=\"/uploads/2016/05/200-3.gif\" width=\"500\"]\r\n\r\nNo one wants a lemon. Be careful with used cars."

If you turn 16 and go get your license, can you immediately drive a tractor trailer out of the parking lot? Fortunately, no. You gotta drive the type of car that’s allowed by your license type. Luckily, the breakdown is pretty easy to remember. Follow along with me, Sesame Street style.\r\n\r\n**Class M** - M is for Moped and Motorcycle. Do you prefer two wheels to four? Driver license class M is for you.\r\n\r\n**Class C** - C means Car. This is your basic license, the one you take [drivers ed](https://www.aceable.com) for. You’ll be able to drive mom and dad’s 1986 Toyota Corolla like a ballaaaaa.\r\n\r\n**Class B** - B stands for Buses. With this license, you can drive non-commercial buses, RVs, and farm vehicles. Super awesome if you’re going on multi-city tour with your band, your Floridian grandparents, and your uncle the farmer.\r\n\r\n**Class A** - A means you’re A+ at driving! You have the powers of both drivers license class B & C combined.\r\n\r\n[image src=\"/uploads/2016/05/giphy-1-2.gif\" alt=\"types of drivers licenses\"]\r\n\r\nThere are different classifications for Commercial Driver Licenses. Are you workin for the man? You’re gonna have to have one of these type of licenses:\r\n\r\n**Class C CDL** - If you’re trying to deliver stuff (small scale) or driving people around, this is the one you need.\r\n\r\n**Class B CDL** - Have you always had it out for people who parked illegally or dreamed of being spitballed by 5-18 year olds? Then you wanna get this type of license. With this, you can drive commercial vehicles like tow trucks, dump trucks, and school buses.\r\n\r\n**Class A CDL** - The end all, be all of driver licenses. With this license, you can drive all the four-wheeled vehicles, including tractor trailers. So getchoo a trucker hat and a Big Gulp and hit the road in your 18 wheels.\r\n\r\nUnless you’re trying to drive anything bigger than a basic SUV or with less than two wheels, your regular ol’ Class C license will be enough. This is what you apply for after you take [Drivers Ed](https://www.aceable.com) and pass your written test."

Our driver's ed courses make it as quick and easy as possible. You’re most likely looking for a regular driver license, but there are plenty of other license types depending on the weight of the vehicle(s) you want to drive, and whether it’s for commercial purposes or not. It's a good idea to know what kind of license you're applying for before starting the licensing process. When you’re applying for your driver license, you’ll also have the opportunity to register to be an organ donor. It’s a personal choice, but Aceable encourages you to join the state registry so that you may save a life (or several!) one day. Be sure to think about this opportunity when you go in to get your license. Ya digg?\r\n\r\nBuying a Car\r\n------------\r\n\r\nLearning to drive is a magical journey on its own, but you’re probably going to need a car too. Getting a vehicle for the first time is 80% awesome and 20% super intimidating. Study up on car-buying and ownership so that you can go into the purchase feeling confident and excited. It’s mostly about thinking through your decisions carefully. Does a new car or a used car make more sense for your needs and your budget? How do you know if you’re getting a reasonable deal with your financing? Based on where you live, does it make sense to get four-wheel-drive or only two-wheel-drive? Have you given the car a test drive yet? Remember, you’re also going to need auto insurance to satisfy state law, a law enforcement officer will definitely ask for this if you're ever stopped. This might sound like a lot to consider, but there's no rush. You have plenty of time before and after you complete your driver test and purchase your first motor vehicle.\r\n\r\nBefore Every Drive\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nThere might be a day where driving is safer thanks to self-driving vehicles, but until that day we suggest that you start building a couple of good habits now, and it might save your life one day. Aceable has created videos to show you the importance of checking the area around your vehicle and buckling up before every drive. Wearing your seatbelt is important for your own safety, and doing a walk-around is a great way to spot hazards in your surroundings and check for any maintenance problems with your car (flat tires, leaking fluids, etc.). Other easy things you can do before getting going is making sure there isn't anything blocking your brake pedal, making sure your windshield wipers turn on, and making sure your seatbelt is on. Also, you’ll obviously wanna keep your car keys and driver license or permit with you any time you're gearing up for a cruise. Oh, and don't forget to make sure your parking brake is turned off!\r\n\r\nWe also recommend checking the weather conditions before you head out for a drive. If there's going to be snow and ice, or if the weather conditions could make you visually impaired, consider staying home. Drive below the speed limit and increasing your following distance at the very least. As a new or teen driver, it's important to develop good habits early on so that they become part of your regular routine before hopping into a motor vehicle.\r\n\r\nSo what are you waiting for? We've just schooled you with so much information about preparing to drive that you have to be feeling confident and ready to get out on the open public road by now. Bottom line: think ahead and make smart decisions. You'll do just fine. Do you find yourself wanting more information on being a smart driver?

Make sure you have the right of way. Turning usually happens at intersections, and it involves changing from one street to another. Anytime this switching is going on, you’ve gotta be mindful of who else is trying to use those roads and whether it’s your turn to turn. Make sure you follow all traffic signals and do a visual scan of the whole area to see if other vehicles, [bicycles](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/sharing-the-road-with-bicycles/), or pedestrians will be in the path of your turn. When the coast is clear and you have the right-of-way, it’s go time.\r\n2. Turn smoothly. Sure, it’s easier said than done, but you’ve got this! The key is to reduce your speed BEFORE you start turning (assuming you’re not turning from a complete stop, as you would at some intersections). Turning at a high speed can throw your vehicle off balance. Get down to the appropriate speed and turn your steering wheel in the desired direction. Once you’re about halfway through the turn, you can start to apply gradual pressure to the accelerator to speed up. Increase your speed gently as you straighten your wheel. That’s how we get turnt!\r\n\r\n**Basic Parking Tips**\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nParking takes a little finesse and a lot of practice, especially if you’re trying to get into some of the smaller, trickier parking spots out there (Looking at you, last available curb spot on the left side of the busy one-way street).\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to parallel parking, the important thing to remember is the order of steps. First, pull up even with the vehicle in front of the empty spot. Then, reverse into space while turning your wheel carefully to guide your vehicle into the spot. Adjust the mirror to spot your tire near the curb. Switchback into drive to straighten your car in the spot. Be patient, and you’ll be parking like a pro soon.\r\n\r\nParking lots are a little easier, but that doesn’t mean you should let your guard down (20% of vehicle accidents happen in parking lots!). Parking lots are busy places full of cars coming and going and pedestrians walking around. Look around very carefully before making your move. Drive super slowly (Yes, we’re talkin’ about 10 mph range) and follow all signs and pavement markings. Driving through a parking lot is still driving.\r\n\r\n**Basic Passing Tips**\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nPassing is risky business. If you do it recklessly, you could cause a serious crash. There are several situations in which you shouldn’t pass:\r\n\r\n- On a two-lane road divided by a solid (not dashed) yellow line\r\n- Within 100 feet of an intersection, tunnel, curve, or hill\r\n- When the vehicle in front of you is going the speed limit\r\n \r\nIf you’re sure it’s legal and necessary to pass, be sure to use your turn signal, pass quickly, and get back into your lane as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nIf you’re the one being passed, be cool about it. Maintain or reduce your speed and keep to the right side of your lane as the vehicle passes you.\r\n\r\nOnly pass when you’re sure it’s safe.\r\n\r\n**Basic Yielding Tips**\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nThere are a lot of right-of-way rules. If you take an Aceable drivers ed course, you’ll learn all of them. But one of the most basic rules is to yield to special vehicles.\r\n\r\nFor example, drivers are legally required to stop and wait for stopped school buses that have their flashing lights activated. This is to protect the safety of kids getting on and off the bus, so be patient.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to emergency vehicles, such as police cars and fire engines, you need to pull over to the right and let them pass you. This is the case whenever the emergency vehicle has its lights and sirens on. Be safe out there!"

Although cell phones are the biggest culprit for driver distractions, there are many others. In our safe driving videos, Aceable can give you more examples of distractions, explain what’s at risk, and prepare you with tips for reducing distractions. We’ll also explain the myth of multitasking (Hint: You can do two things at once, but that means doing neither of them well).\r\n\r\nImpaired Driving\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nAlcohol-related crashes are depressingly frequent and quite often fatal. Even if no one gets physically hurt (that’s a big “if”), being convicted of DUI or DWI will wreck you financially. If you’re under 21 years old, it’s particularly important for you to understand Zero Tolerance and how to navigate social situations involving alcohol without messing up your life.

Find out how you can make it through long road trips and early morning commutes without putting yourself and others in danger.\r\n\r\nAggressive Driving\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nDrivers who lose their cool can make some really dumb choices on the road. Everyone runs late sometimes or has the occasional bad mood, but taking out your aggression on other vehicles is really dangerous. How do you stay calm? How do you stay safe when people out there are tailgating, cutting you off, or just being jerks? Aceable can show you how to avoid road rage and stay chill on the road."

You might get stranded in a remote location in the middle of a blizzard. Your car might suddenly overheat and break down in the desert. Before you even begin driving through hazardous conditions, let’s talk about what you want to pack in your car. You want to make sure you’re ready for any emergency that can come your way -- it could literally save your life one day. Oh, and don't forget to check the weather channel before you head out for the day. We know you're on your phone for 20 minutes before you get up in the morning anyway.\r\n\r\n![Driving In Hazardous Conditions](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/giphy-1-19.gif) Pack your bags, but please come back.\r\n\r\nThings you should pack in your car for emergencies:\r\n\r\n- **For snow**:\r\n- Ice scraper: Have you ever tried to get ice off of your car without one of these things? We don't recommend trying.\r\n- Warm blanket (space blanket recommended): If your car breaks down, guess what? Your heat isn't going to work. A space blanket could be your saving grace on a cold winter highway.\r\n- Kitty litter and a shovel: \"Why the heck would I need my cat's bathroom floor to deal with snow and ice?!\" you might be asking yourself. If you ever get stuck in the snow or ice, kitty litter can create enough traction for your tires to get you out of a tricky situation. A shovel is also helpful for digging out snow-lodged tires.\r\n- Hat and gloves: This one is pretty standard. You want to be able to keep warm if you ever end up having to deal with your car in any way when it's cold out.\r\n- **For heat**:\r\n- Bottles of water: If you're stuck on the side of the highway on a day hotter than Queen Bey herself, you're going to want to hydrate. Trust us.\r\n- Coolant: This liquid keeps your car from overheating. If you're ever low on coolant and your car is starting to overheat, you're going to want this available asap.\r\n- Washcloths: These are helpful to have on hand at all times for random emergencies and messes. Not to mention, they could come in handy cleaning up any sweat puddles you might create if your AC or engine goes out in the summer. Yuck.\r\n- **For rain**:\r\n- Extra clothes: You're definitely going to want a change of clothes if you get stuck in the rain. Having some packed and loaded will have you sending past-you a thank you fruit basket if you ever have to utilize them.\r\n- Extra windshield wipers: If you lose a wiper in the middle of a rainy drive, you don't want to get stuck waiting for the weather to clear up in order to make it home. Having a spare set available means you can pull over and swap them out if needed.\r\n- Poncho or other waterproof covering: You're driving to pick up bae for date night and BAM! It starts pouring. What do you do? Grab your handy poncho and look oh so fly when you come knocking at her door.\r\n- **For always**:\r\n- Flares, maps, matches, first-aid kit (including bandages, medication, ointment, etc), flashlight, portable food items (such as Clif bars), car phone charger, whatever else you think could be important. This is what trunks are for!\r\n\r\nHaving these items on hand could help you get safely out of potentially life-threatening situations and keep you prepared for dangerous drives. When packing your car, think about what kinds of things *could* happen when driving in hazardous weather conditions (breakdown, car accident, etc.) so you can always be prepared.\r\n\r\n**Other Safe Driving Topics** Select a Topic Preparing to Drive Basic Driving Maneuvers Defensive Driving Basics Distracted &amp; Impaired Driving Driving in Hazardous Conditions Driving in Emergency Situations Understanding Right of Way Common Traffic Signs Vehicle Maintenance ![Driving In Hazardous Conditions](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/giphy-2-16.gif) Ready for anything.\r\n\r\n**Drive to Conditions**\r\n-----------------------\r\n\r\nWhen you’re driving in severe weather conditions, it’s very important to adjust to your surroundings. The road conditions can make a huge difference in how you'll want to handle driving your car. Is it raining or snowing so hard that you have almost zero visibility? Is there freezing rain or the possibility of black ice on the ground? You should slow way, way down under the speed limit and make sure you’ve got plenty of space between yourself other drivers (at least two car lengths on an icy road) so you don't lose control. If it gets too hard to see, pull as far off the road as you can, turn your hazard lights on, and wait for it to clear up until you feel comfortable continuing on your way. Are you driving up a giant mountain in 100+ temps while carrying six people and two dogs? You’ll probably want to turn your A/C off to save your car from overheating. Is a sun glare making it hard for you to see? Make sure you keep a pair of shades in your car for these instances. Inclement weather can be scary, but you're way better off if you're in the know on how to be prepared for these situations.\r\n\r\n![Driving In Hazardous Conditions](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/giphy-24.gif) You’ll start and end on the bottom if you do this during a blizzard.\r\n\r\nWhenever you get in situations that are less than ideal, the best thing you can do is use your common sense. If you feel unsafe driving 65mph in heavy rain with a wet road, it’s probably because you are unsafe. Slow down so you avoid hydroplaning and losing control of your vehicle. You got this, fam.\r\n\r\n![Driving In Hazardous Conditions](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/giphy-1-18.gif) Now this will never be you.\r\n\r\nCheck out our videos on driving in hazardous conditions to learn more about specific bad weather situations: wet, hot, and snowy.

Don’t be the person that the emergency vehicle is rescuing. Be aware of the common causes of motor vehicle crashes so that you’re not the person involved in one. Check out our video courses on the most common causes of accidents -- an informed driver is a smart driver after all.\r\n\r\n**Distracted Driving**\r\n\r\n- Put those cell phones down and keep both hands on the steering wheel. Texting while driving is never okay. Ever. Bae can wait on those kissy face emoji texts you're trying to send. (And not to burst your bubble, but hands-free devices aren’t much better.)\r\n\r\n**Going Over the Speed Limit**\r\n\r\n- Think you have the need for speed? That police officer with a radar gun probably won’t agree. You could end up with a ticket, or worse. So take your lead foot off the gas pedal and stay within the speed limit. Law enforcement officials don't take speeding lightly, and neither should you.\r\n \r\nTeen Car Crashes\r\n----------------\r\n\r\nTeenagers make up the age group most likely to get into a motor vehicle accident. The most common reason? Driver error, as opposed to car or environmental factors. Teenagers are brand new to the driver seat, so their driving skills and reaction times are not as refined as that of older adults. That’s why it’s important for teens to pay close attention in drivers education and listen to their driving instructor before getting behind the wheel. Teach knows what’s up.\r\n\r\nPotential Roadside Emergencies\r\n------------------------------\r\n\r\nEven if you do everything right -- follow traffic signals, change lanes correctly, refrain from text messaging, adhere to speed limits, increase following distance in snow and ice, and check your blind spots -- you still might end up as the one needing emergency response. Luckily, if you’re fully aware of and prepared for driving in emergencies, you’ll be much better off. We're not trying to scare you, but this is some serious stuff, capeesh?\r\n\r\n- Wear your seat belt … always! Click it or ticket, guys. A safety belt could save your life and keep you from taking a ride in an emergency vehicle.\r\n- Know that defensive driving is a life-saving strategy. Follow traffic laws, but don’t expect that others always will. Have situational awareness and stay alert!\r\n- Take the right steps if involved in a car crash. Pull over. Put on your parking brake. Turn on your emergency flashers. Cooperate with law enforcement officers and the emergency medical team. If you have a personal injury, be sure to seek medical attention ASAP.\r\n- Always have a basic emergency kit on hand. The more prepared you are for a sudden emergency, the better. You can find different emergency car kit lists online and determine which would work best for you based on your location and the usual weather conditions there.\r\n- Keep weather conditions in mind when you're on the road. Driving in heavy rain or snow and ice means you should be taking extra safety precautions. This can also affect what kinds of items you should have on your emergency car kit checklist- like hats, gloves, and kitty litter.\r\n\r\nRemember: Even safe drivers can get in accidents. So just continue to be aware of other drivers and do your part to be responsible on the road. Being conscious of your surroundings, and practicing safe driving habits can help you prevent personal injury or a medical emergency. Until the world is filled with self-driving cars and in-car computers, we’ll still have to deal with human error in car accidents. Personally, I’d rather have a self-driving magic carpet, but that’s up to Google and/or that genie from Aladdin to bring me one."

But that would be terrible, so let’s talk about what to do when you get to all different types of intersections and stop signs. Understanding right of way is an essential skill for being a safe, courteous driver. A lot of these rules are based on common sense and the ability to read a situation and make the right choice, but it’s also important to know the right of way laws rules so you can react with confidence and keep a clean driving record. You'll learn a lot about the topic when you take your driver education courses and take the test for your driver's course, but it's always nice to have a little extra info, or a place to refresh that knowledge if needed. Click the web page links below to get started viewing some of our videos on the topic and get on board with some good driving techniques.\r\n\r\nRight of Way Instructional Videos\r\n---------------------------------\r\n\r\n- [Giving Right of Way](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/right-of-way-at-t-intersections/)\r\n- Right of Way at Uncontrolled Intersections\r\n- [Right of Way at T-intersections](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/right-of-way-at-t-intersections/)\r\n- [Right of Way on Different Pavement Surfaces](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/right-of-way-different-pavement-surfaces/)\r\n- [Right of Way on Different Laned Roads](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/right-of-way-different-landed-roads/)\r\n- [Right of Way During Left Turns](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/right-of-way-left-turns/)\r\n- Right of Way from Private Roads to Public Streets\r\n\r\nRight of Way Rules\r\n------------------\r\n\r\n- Controlled intersections\r\n- Lights or signs\r\n- Uncontrolled intersections\r\n- No lights or signs\r\n- T-intersections\r\n- Different pavement surfaces\r\n- Different laned Roads\r\n- Left turns\r\n\r\nBasically, anywhere one roadway/pathway intersects with another is when you need to be on the lookout for other drivers and pedestrians (even more than you usually are, anyway). Not only do you have to be aware of other vehicles and cyclists, but right of way rules also apply to pedestrians. In places of high pedestrian density, such as schools or parking lots, you will have to yield right of way to those not in vehicles to avoid pedestrian accidents.\r\n\r\nWhen it comes to right of way, it’s better to be a giver than a taker. You can’t go around taking right of way all willy-nilly, but you also shouldn’t just give it away all the time either - or you’ll never get anywhere. Think of it as a compromise. If acting in a way that doesn't follow basic traffic rules, such as giving right of way when it is clearly yours to take, then you could cause driver confusion, which can cause an accident.\r\n\r\nThe last thing to remember about right of way is that you should *always* yield right of way to emergency vehicles. They’ve got forever dibs on right of way. If you see emergency lights flashing, pull over and let them pass no matter what. They've got important places to be. (Yes, a lot more important than that TV show you're rushing home to).\r\n\r\nWhile right of way rules aren’t complicated, they’re very important to know and understand in order to be a safe driver. A large portion of deciding when it's your turn to go is simple logic. Take some time to check out our videos on the different rules for different intersections so you can feel 100% on the road and have a safe drive wherever you're going."

Traffic signs and traffic lights make up a huge majority of tools called traffic control devices. These devices, along with pavement markings, are meant to keep everyone on the road safe by controlling how people get to drive and when they get to do it. Basically, the traffic flow is controlled and regulated by these traffic control devices.\r\n\r\nStreet signs are like Pokemon. Some you’ll see all the time and know exactly what they mean and some you’ll only see on rare occasions and aren’t super sure about them. What we want to do is make sure you understand each of these traffic signs, even the rare Legendary Pokemon ones. Whether it's a standard stop sign, or a less common one like a hazardous area or road work sign, you should be prepared for anything that comes your way.\r\n\r\nWhen we’re talking about common road signs, we mean things like: Stop signs, Sharp Turn Ahead signs, and Yield signs. When we talk about rare signs, we mean signs with unusual names that you don’t see as often, such as Crossbuck, T-Junction, and Crossover. All of these are super important for you to know and understand if you want to be a safe, smart driver who cares about traffic safety (and you do, trust us). Being a boss at understanding road traffic means being a safe driver- something you'll definitely be when you get your driver license."

They will cut you off (is it just me, or is it always someone in a BMW? Every. Single. Time.). They will probably try to Instagram their breakfast while merging into the turn lane too. Simply following the rules of the road isn’t always enough to keep you safe. You have to defend yourself. [Defensive driving](https://www.aceable.com/defensive-driving/texas/) is all about preventing accidents. You're not just saving yourself; you're saving other drivers from their own bad choices. Just because a potential crash would not be your fault doesn't mean you shouldn't do everything you can to prevent it. Dealing with car repair shops and insurance claims isn’t everyone’s idea of a good time. If you want to protect your car, your life, and your good vibes, defensive driving techniques are a must. Here are the defensive driving basics you need to know:\r\n\r\nWatch Our Defensive Driving Videos\r\n----------------------------------\r\n\r\n- [The 6 Vehicle Zones](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/six-vehicle-zones/)\r\n- [Aggressive Drivers](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/aggressive-drivers-and-how-to-avoid-them/)\r\n- [Blind Spots](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/blind-spots/)\r\n- [Central vs. Peripheral Vision](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/vision-while-driving/)\r\n- [Following Intervals](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/safe-following-distance/)\r\n- [Lane Positions on the Highway](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/lane-positions-on-the-highway/)\r\n- [Steering Out of a Skid](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/steering-out-of-a-skid/)\r\n- [Visual Targeting](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/visual-targeting-strategies/)\r\n- [Hidden Operating Space](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/driving-space-and-management/)\r\n- [Taking Caution When Trucks Make Wide Right Turns](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/trucks-make-wide-right-turns/)\r\n- [Sharing the Road With Bicyclists](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/sharing-the-road-with-bicycles/)\r\n- [Pedestrians](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/understanding-right-of-way/)\r\n\r\nSchool License #E0803\r\n\r\n#### CALIFORNIA TRAFFIC VIOLATOR SCHOOL\r\n\r\nMask your speeding ticket or earn a discount on your auto insurance.

Are you pretty sure that any given driver sharing the road with you is either drunk, sleep deprived, or [totally distracted](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/easy-ways-to-reduce-distractions-when-youre-driving/)? This kind of mentality will serve you well. You can’t count on a driver to make a turn just because they have their turn signal on. That would be too easy. You also can’t depend on other people to yield the right of way to you when it’s obviously your turn. Some drivers are confused about right-of-way rules in different situations, and many of them just aren’t paying enough attention to notice you or make a smart decision about who should get to go first. Be cautious and alert when you approach a turn, an intersection, or merging lane. Don’t assume you have the right of way until you’re sure the other vehicle(s) are actually slowing down or stopping for you. When in doubt, always yield the right of way to others. It’s the safest course of action, and it’s downright considerate of you. While you’re on this path of virtuous choices, make sure you’re completely fit to drive as well. Don’t drive if you’re too tired to stay awake or make quick decisions. Don’t touch your phone while driving either. You can respond to that text from bae when you're at a stopping point. And don’t even think about putting your key in the ignition if you’ve been drinking alcohol. Seriously, don't do it.\r\n\r\n2. Be Predictable\r\n-----------------\r\n\r\nIf your occupation is \"Free Spirit,\" that's fine. We won't judge. But make sure you're less wild behind the wheel.\r\n\r\nMaybe you’re wild at heart -- a real free spirit letting fate carry you through life on its majestic wings. That’s great. But when you’re behind the wheel, it’s best to be as predictable as possible. Let other drivers know what you’re going to do BEFORE you do it. This means using your turn signals every time you turn or change lanes, tapping your brakes to make your brake lights flash when you need to slow down quickly. You can even tap your horn when you suspect that another driver doesn’t see you and might cause a crash. Make eye contact with a pedestrian who’s about to cross the street so they know you see them. And nothing says “I’m definitely not going to run over you” like throwing in a friendly wave.\r\n\r\n3. Protect Your Space\r\n---------------------\r\n\r\nDon’t you hate it when people get into your personal bubble? Standing too close to someone for no good reason is creepy. Driving too close to someone isn’t just creepy -- it’s really dangerous too. Ideally, you want to keep a decent cushion of space around your vehicle on all sides. Your [following distance](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/safe-following-distance/) (the distance between your car and the car in front of you) should vary based on how fast you’re driving, and it’s measured in seconds. To find your following distance, wait for the vehicle in front of you to pass some sort of landmark: a tree, a sign for Pizza Palace, a hitchhiker, whatev. Count the number of seconds that go by until your vehicle passes the same landmark. You want to keep at least two seconds' worth of space in front of you. Lengthen your following distance if you’re driving faster than 35 mph or if the roads are slick.\r\n\r\nResisting the urge to tailgate is a great start, but what about the vehicles to your left and right? First, don’t drive directly next to them. That’s super awkward. Also, [stay out of their blind spots](https://www.aceable.com/safe-driving/blind-spots/). Every vehicle has areas that the driver can’t see from their rearview or side mirrors. If you’re chilling near the back corner of someone’s car in traffic, there’s a chance that the driver could fail to see you while making a lane change. Just keep that space bubble as large as possible. Protecting your space, as it turns out, means you’ll protect others’ space as well. Pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorcycles will appreciate you keeping your distance.\r\n\r\n4. Anticipate Problems\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nMake sure you’re seeing the big picture when you’re behind the wheel. It’s easy to fixate on the area directly in front of you, but try not to. Never stop scanning the environment around you for hazards. Put those mirrors to use every once in a while. Check for safety threats that are one block or a quarter of a mile ahead. The more time you can give yourself to react to a potential hazard, the better off you’ll be. Gather as much information as you can while driving. Is there a bicyclist coming up behind you at the stoplight? Is a child going to come running after that basketball that just rolled into the street? Now that we’ve established that the world is a dangerous place with potential crashes waiting around every corner, let’s go over escape routes real quick. We’re not talking trap doors and helicopter rescues. An escape route is a plan for where to go if things turn ugly. Notice which lanes around you are open in case you need to switch your position in a hurry. Is there a paved shoulder you can get on if the driver in front of you comes to a screeching halt without any warning? Brakes aren’t always the answer. Most drivers can steer away from a potential crash slightly faster than they can avoid it by bringing their vehicle to a stop. Speaking of brakes, are you familiar with cover braking? It’s a lifesaver in unpredictable city environments. You simply keep your foot over the brake pedal (without actually pressing it), so that you’re ready to brake on short notice. Sometimes shaving off that fraction of a second makes a big difference in avoiding a crash.\r\n\r\n5. Plan Ahead\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nThe more prepared you are for your trip, the more attention you can devote to identifying and reacting to hazards. It doesn’t matter if you’re on a cross-country road trip or taking a quick drive to the grocery store. All your travels can benefit from a little planning. The first step is to know your route. If it’s a new, unfamiliar journey, check out a map beforehand and queue up the directions in your GPS if you’ve got one. Don’t wait until the last second to get in your exit or turn lane. For local trips, check your favorite news source for warnings about the weather, traffic, or construction. Use this info to estimate how much time you’ll need for your drive. Running late or being in a rush can tempt even the best of us to speed or drive a little more aggressively than we should. Detours and changes in traffic are bound to happen (seriously, another parade shutting down streets during rush hour?). Just roll with it. One more way to plan ahead is to keep up with your vehicle maintenance. Make sure you have enough gasoline for your trips, check your tire pressure monthly, and don’t drive around with that “Check Engine” light on for weeks on end. Defensive driving isn’t just something you do once and check off a list. It’s a lifestyle, okay?
