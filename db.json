When a bigger road intersects with a smaller road, the road with the most lanes always has right of way, meaning vehicles on that road do not have to stop or yield to let other cars in. Let’s explore what happens when a road with one lane meets a road with multiple lanes.\r\n\r\n[youtube video_id=\"6Khj27j_OzM\" max_width=\"500\"]"

            "Body": "Traffic circles, sometimes called rotaries (if they’re large scale) or roundabouts, are a type of circular intersection. Yes, they’re round and strange and you might find them confusing at first, but remember: it’s just an intersection.\n\nIn addition to providing a nice little center island green space with shrubs to drive around, roundabouts, with their yield signs and low speeds, are actually safer than your average four-way intersection. They can also be way less confusing once you get the hang of them since every motor vehicle is turning in a clockwise direction. They're also much easier for large vehicles and emergency vehicles to navigate.\n\n**Who has the right of way?**\n-----------------------------\n\nIt’s pretty simple. If a vehicle is already in the traffic circle, they have the right of way.\n\nYou wouldn’t walk right up to a cashier and try to check out at the store if someone else was in the middle of getting their groceries scanned, right? Just wait your turn and everything will be great.\n\nIn some situations, there may be a traffic control device like a stop sign or stoplight at each entrance of the modern roundabout. If that’s the case, do what these traffic signals say. There will usually be some kind of roundabout guide like a pavement marking or sign at the entrances giving you an idea of how to proceed.\n\n![traffic circle](https://aceable.wpengine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lane-control-sign.png) Traffic circle lane control sign, courtesy California Department of Transportation\n\n**How do you drive in a traffic circle?**\n-----------------------------------------\n\nWhen you get to the traffic roundabout and see that it’s clear of other vehicles, bicyclists, and pedestrians, it’s time to join the circular party. Turn RIGHT, do not make a left turn. Traffic circles are basically one-way streets. A left turn into a roundabout would feel totally wrong, and you could end up in a head-on collision.\n\nContinue driving along the circle following traffic flow until you reach the street that you want to exit. If you’re in the interior lane of a really big circle, you will need to change lanes to exit. You'll always need to be in the right lane to exit. Simply merge onto the street of your choice. See? Not so bad."

Buy a pot of extremely [rare Chinese tea](http://www.bbc.com/travel/story/20160425-the-pot-of-tea-that-costs-10000). Any of these options is a better way to spend $10,000 than paying for a DUI. Drinking and driving is one of the worst things a person can do. Find out how much a DUI could cost you (Spoiler: It will cost you more than just money.)\r\n\r\n Cost of Life\r\n------------\r\n\r\nIn 2013, in the state of Texas alone, there were 25,158 alcohol-related crashes resulting in 1,022 deaths. Over a thousand people had their lives cut short, many of them being innocent victims who paid the ultimate price for someone else’s mistake. Drunk driving often leads to terrible, irreversible consequences. It’s not worth the risk.\r\n\r\nCost of Freedom\r\n---------------\r\n\r\nIf you’re convicted of driving under the influence, life as you know it will get worse for a while. You could be assigned up to 100 hours of community service. You know what’s better than spending your Saturday mornings picking up garbage? Almost anything else. You could even get jail time. If you like having the freedom to wear, eat, and do what you want, avoid that jail life. Don’t drink and drive.\r\n\r\nFinancial Cost\r\n--------------\r\n\r\nAs mentioned earlier, DUI’s simply cost a whole lotta money. We’re talkin’ legal fees, fines, increased insurance premiums, and bail. The total bill can easily reach $10,000. That’s not even counting the money you’re missing out on via lost wages. Every day you spend in jail, doing community service, or going to court is a day you could have spent making money at work or just enjoying life."
