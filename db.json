            "MultiColumnBody": "<p><strong>Background</strong>. This end user license agreement and terms of service (this “Agreement”) sets forth the legally binding terms between Aceable Inc. (\"Aceable,\" “us,” or “we”) and you, as an end user of an iOS, Android, or Web application offered by Aceable (collectively, the “App”) through which we offer the driver instruction course for which you have registered (the “Course”).</p>\n<p>By clicking the “I AGREE” button or by installing the App, you agree, effective as of such date (the “Effective Date”) to be bound by this Agreement.</p>\n<p>YOU ARE ONLY AUTHORIZED TO USE THE APP AND TO TAKE THE COURSE IF YOU AGREE TO ABIDE BY ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND THIS AGREEMENT. PLEASE READ THIS AGREEMENT CAREFULLY AND SAVE IT. IF YOU DO NOT AGREE WITH IT, YOU SHOULD NOT INSTALL THE APP OR SHOULD DISCONTINUE USE IMMEDIATELY.</p>\n<p><strong>Representations About You</strong>. The App is not designed for use by children under the age of 13, and we do not intentionally collect personal information from children through the App. Thus, you represent and warrant to us that you are at least 13 years of age. If you are 13 or older but under the age of 18, you must review this Agreement with your own parent or guardian to make sure that you and your parent or guardian understand it and that they agree to it on your behalf. Also, you represent and warrant that the information that you provide to us about you in connection with the App will be current, true, accurate, supportable and complete, and promise that you will update this information to keep it current. When using the App while in a vehicle, you agree to not interact with the App unless your vehicle is stationary.</p>\n<p><strong>Driver Requirements in Your Jurisdiction</strong>. In addition to taking a course like the Course, there are almost certainly additional requirements in your state in order to receive a learner license, instruction permit, learner’s permit, driver’s license or similar license, including requirements to complete a “behind the wheel” driving instruction course offered by a third party. You acknowledge and agree that it is your sole responsibility to comply with any such requirements. A list of states in which the Course is approved to meet certain licensing requirements (or portions thereof) is set forth in our <strong><a href=\"https://www.aceable.com/tandc/\">State-Specific Terms page</a></strong>. You hereby agree to comply with any state-specific requirements for your jurisdiction set forth in the State-Specific Terms. Aceable does not represent or warrant that the Course will meet the requirements of any other jurisdiction. If a Course is not approved by the state regulatory authorities in your jurisdiction, you may only use the App and the Course for general educational purposes. You use the App at your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable laws.</p>\n<p><strong>License Grant</strong>. Subject to the terms of this Agreement, Aceable hereby grants you a limited, non-exclusive and nontransferable license to download, install and use the App on a single smart phone, tablet or other mobile device that you own or control and to use the content, including text, pictures, videos, links and information or instructions made available to you through the App (“Content”) for your personal, non-commercial use.</p>\n<p><strong>License Restrictions</strong>. You shall not: (i) copy the App or any Content, except as expressly permitted by this license; (ii) modify, translate, adapt, or otherwise create derivative works or improvements of the App or the Course; (iii) reverse engineer, disassemble, decompile, decode or otherwise attempt to derive or gain access to the source code of the App or any part thereof; (iv) remove, delete, alter or obscure any trademarks or any copyright, trademark, patent or other intellectual property or proprietary rights notice from the App or the Course; or (v) rent, lease, lend, sell, sublicense, assign, distribute, publish, transfer or otherwise make available the App or the Course or any features or functionality of the App, to any third party for any reason, including making the App available on a network where it is capable of being accessed by more than one device at any time. If for some reason these restrictions are prohibited by applicable law or by an agreement we have with one of our licensors, then the activities are permitted only to the extent necessary to comply with such law or license(s).</p>\n<p><strong>Reservation of Rights</strong>. You acknowledge that the App and the Course is licensed, not sold, to you. Aceable reserves all rights in and to the App and the Course not expressly granted to you under this Agreement. You do not acquire any ownership interest in the App or the Course under this Agreement. Aceable and its licensors reserve and retain the entire right title and interest in and to the App and the Course, including all copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property rights therein or relating thereto, except as expressly granted to you in this Agreement. If you submit comments, suggestions, or other feedback regarding the App (“Feedback”), Aceable will be free to use such Feedback for any purpose. “Aceable” and all associated logos displayed within the App are our trademarks (unless otherwise noted).</p>\n<p><strong>Data</strong>. In exchange for Aceable providing you with access to the App, you consent to Aceable collecting and using technical data in connection with your use of the App (“Data”), including technical information about your device, system, software and peripherals. You agree and acknowledge that Aceable owns all right, title, and interest in and to any Data that is collected by Aceable from you as the result of your use of the App. Aceable may use such Data for any lawful purpose without a duty of accounting, including without limitation (i) in order to provide the App to you, (ii) as necessary to monitor and improve the App, and (iii) to collect, develop, create, extract or otherwise generate statistics and other information and to otherwise compile, synthesize and analyze such Data (“Blind Data”), provided that Aceable agrees that it shall not use the Data in any manner in which you would be identified.</p>\n<p><strong>Confidentiality</strong>. You acknowledge that the App, the Content, the terms of this Agreement, and any other proprietary or confidential information provided by Aceable constitutes Aceable’s valuable proprietary information and trade secrets (“Confidential Information”). The information you provide to us about you (such as your name, address, date of birth and email address) and your test results will constitute your Confidential Information. Each party agrees to preserve the confidential nature of the other’s Confidential Information by retaining and using it in trust and confidence, solely for its internal use except as provided herein, and by using the same degree of protection that such party uses to protect similar proprietary and confidential information, but in no event less than reasonable care, provided that we may transfer your Confidential Information to our partners as may be necessary to deliver the App, the Course, or the Certificate of Completion to you, and to our successors and assigns in connection with a corporate transaction. Each party shall have the right to seek an injunction (without having to post a bond) to prevent any breach or continued breach of this section.</p>\n<p><strong>Acknowledgements Regarding Apple, Inc., Google Inc. and other App Store Providers</strong>. You acknowledge that this Agreement is between you and Aceable and not with Apple, Inc. (“Apple”), Google Inc.

State-Specific Terms and the Supplemental Terms Applicable to Paid Features section below are examples of Supplemental Terms. If we offer other features through or related to the App, other supplemental terms may apply. We will present such additional Supplemental Terms for review and acceptance at the time of the supplemental activity. Supplemental Terms are different from Third Party Terms (defined below) in that Supplemental Terms relate to offerings provided by Aceable, whereas Third Party Terms relate to third party offerings. In the event of any conflict between the terms hereof and any Supplemental Terms, the Supplemental Terms shall govern with respect to the matters contemplated thereby. Additional terms from Aceable.com apply, which can be found at <a href=\"https://www.aceable.com/tandc/\">Aceable Terms &amp; Conditions</a> and in the event of any conflict between those terms and any other terms including these terms, the terms found at <a href=\"https://www.aceable.com/tandc/\">Aceable Terms &amp; Conditions</a> shall prevail.</p>\n<p><strong>Third Party Offerings</strong>.

We are not responsible for such third party offerings.</p>\n<p><strong>Acknowledgement Regarding SMS Messages and Push Notifications</strong>.

This section is important – please read it carefully. It limits Aceable’s liability (and the liability of its affiliates) to you. These disclaimers and limitations apply only to the extent permitted by applicable law.

The section titles in this Agreement are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. This Agreement operates to the fullest extent permissible by law. You may not transfer or assign this Agreement or any of its rights or obligations hereunder without our prior written consent, and any attempt to do so shall be null and void.

Users may purchase additional Course materials and modules (“Paid Content”) within the App. Upon receipt of the payment described herein and subject to your adherence to the terms and conditions of the Agreement, we will make the Paid Content available to you. The foregoing does not diminish our ability to terminate your account (without refund) in the event of a breach of the Agreement, or if we cease to support the App.</p>\n<p><strong>Payment Terms</strong>. To access Paid Content, certain fees will apply. All fees are payable in U.S. dollars, non-refundable (except to the extent set forth below) and are exclusive of applicable sales, excise, use or similar taxes.
