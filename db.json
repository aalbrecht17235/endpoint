When your car runs, the moving parts rub against each other and create heat. Vehicle oil lubricates these parts and absorbs some of that heat. That's why it's so important to stay on top of your car maintenance and get regular oil changes. If your engine parts are grinding and wearing down, your check engine light will end up turning on before you know it. Your warranty won't cover bad car maintenance, my friend. Let's get started!</p>\n<h3>When to Check Your Car's Oil Levels</h3>\n<p>It's recommended to check your vehicle's oil level once a month. If you see this symbol:</p>\n<template><ShortcodeImage :config='{\"alt\":\"How to Check Your Oil\",\"src\":\"\\/uploads\\/sites\\/4\\/2018\\/10\\/GettyImages-528628360.jpg\",\"shortcode-classes\":\"d-flex py-3\",\"shortcode-extension-classes\":\"justify-content-center\"}' shortcode-classes='d-flex py-3' shortcode-extension-classes='justify-content-center'></ShortcodeImage></template>\n<p>This symbol indicates the oil needs to be checked <em>immediately</em> because you either have too little or too much oil in your engine. If you notice that your check oil light comes on a lot, go see a mechanic ASAP to make sure you don't have a leak.</p>\n<p>To keep your engine in prime condition, make sure you’re getting your oil changed every 3 months or 3,000  5,000 miles. Car maintenance doesn't take all that much time out of your day, but will help keep your car in good and engine in condition!</p>\n<h3>How to Check Your Car's Oil Step-by-Step</h3>\n<h4>Step 1: Turn Off the Car</h4>\n<p>First thing's first, make sure your vehicle engine is off and that it’s been sitting for while on level ground. You want the engine to be cool, not hot like it had just been running. Go ahead and pop the hood!</p>\n<h4>Step 2: Find the Oil Dipstick</h4>\n<p>Next, you’ll want to find the oil dipstick. Your dipstick usually has an orange or yellow top and sticks out near your engine. There should be a loop that you can grab onto, but there might not be. All cars are different, so you might have to consult your owner’s manual if you are having trouble finding it.</p>\n<template><ShortcodeImage :config='{\"alt\":\"How to Check Your Oil\",\"src\":\"\\/uploads\\/sites\\/4\\/2018\\/10\\/GettyImages-184148872.jpg\",\"shortcode-classes\":\"d-flex py-3\",\"shortcode-extension-classes\":\"justify-content-center\"}' shortcode-classes='d-flex py-3' shortcode-extension-classes='justify-content-center'></ShortcodeImage></template>\n<h4>Step 3: Pull Out the Dipstick</h4>\n<p>Grab the oil dipstick, pull it out, and wipe the end with a lint-free rag or a paper towel. When the dipstick is clean, dip it fully back into the pipe and pull it out again.</p>\n<h4>Step 4: Assess the Level</h4>\n<p>When you pull the dipstick back out, take a look at the bottom and see where on the stick the oil covers. There are two small fluid level lines marked on your oil dipstick letting you know where the minimum and maximum oil level should reach. There should be motor oil covering the dipstick up to the maximum mark.</p>\n<h4>Step 5: Adjust Oil Levels if Needed</h4>\n<p>If the level is good, shove that puppy back into the pipe and call it a day. If not, you might have to add oil to the engine. To do this, remove the oil cap and carefully pour in the correct amount until the oil level reaches the line marked on your dipstick. Check out your vehicle’s owner manual for info on where the oil goes, what kind you need (synthetic oil, 5W-30, 10W-40, etc.), and how much you should add. These ratios can vary depending on a number of factors like if you have a diesel engine or if you use synthetic oil.</p>\n<p>If the tank requires a whole quart of oil to get it to the right level, it’s way too low and you should probably check in with a mechanic so they can make sure you don't have an oil leak.</p>\n<p>There you have it! Step-by-step instructions to checking your oil levels and determining if they're in the right place to keep your car running smoothly.

This gets rid of 80% of the anxiety that comes with owning a car and taking care of it. The right mechanic is going to understand the history of your car and the health of it, and be able to track it over a long period of time. The right mechanic has your back, cares about your car and wants to make sure you have a good experience.</p>\n<template><ShortcodeImage :config='{\"alt\":\"how to find the right mechanic\",\"src\":\"\\/uploads\\/2018\\/05\\/primary-auto-care-technician-1024x683.jpg\",\"width\":\"500\",\"shortcode-classes\":\"d-flex py-3\",\"shortcode-extension-classes\":\"justify-content-center\"}' shortcode-classes='d-flex py-3' shortcode-extension-classes='justify-content-center'></ShortcodeImage></template>\n<h3>How to Find the Right Mechanic</h3>\n<p>There are a few steps you'll want to take when finding a new mechanic.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Understand that there are a few different options out there</strong>. Any of the below options can be great choices, and each come with their own benefits that you can asses as you do your research! <ol>\n<li>Dealerships</li>\n<li>Chains</li>\n<li>Independent repair shops</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li><strong><strong>Ask for a referral.</strong></strong> Ask your friends, family, anyone you trust. If you're a woman, you want to ask another woman because women's experiences are very different than men's at a repair garage. You can even ask your local automotive school if they have any recommendations of where to take your car so you know you're going to a knowledgeable and fair mechanic.</li>\n<li><strong><strong>Go into the shop.</strong></strong> It's a good idea to go in person and talk to the mechanic. You want to see how they treat other customers and their employees. If they're pleasant, polite and respectable then there's a good chance that's how they'll treat you too. While talking on the phone might be easier, we recommend going in and talking to a mechanic, especially if it's your first time there.</li>\n<li><strong>Make sure they can explain what's going on with your car.</strong> A great mechanic is going to be able to explain exactly what's going on with your car in a way you understand and feel comfortable with. You should never feel pressured into getting a repair, uncertain if you really need it, or concerned about whether the price is fair. If a mechanic can't tell you what's going on with your car, get out of there, because they probably don't understand it themselves.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Good Mechanics vs. Great Mechanics</h3>\n<p>A great mechanic <strong>WON'T</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Try to sell you on everything under the sun or upsell you on things you don't need</li>\n<li>Get impatient or frustrated explaining what's going on with your car</li>\n<li>Won't price gauge you or make repairs you don't need.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A great mechanic <strong>WILL</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Understand that paying for a car can be very expensive and work to make you feel comfortable</li>\n<li>Understand what a car needs to get it running safely</li>\n<li>Tell you what you need to fix now and what can wait for later</li>\n<li>Help you plan out future repairs you'll eventually need, because they can be very expensive</li>\n<li>Be patient and thorough when diagnosing a car</li>\n<li>Be honest about limitations they have when fixing your car</li>\n</ul>\n<p>At the end of the day, if you don't feel comfortable talking with your mechanic about your car, get out of that shop! The right mechanic will be honest and make you feel comfortable about any repairs you need to get!</p>\n<template><ShortcodeImage :config='{\"alt\":\"finding the right auto mechanic\",\"src\":\"\\/uploads\\/2018\\/05\\/How-to-find-an-auto-mechanic.png\",\"width\":\"500\",\"shortcode-classes\":\"d-flex py-3\",\"shortcode-extension-classes\":\"justify-content-center\"}' shortcode-classes='d-flex py-3' shortcode-extension-classes='justify-content-center'></ShortcodeImage></template>\n<p>Still need a new ride before finding a mechanic?
